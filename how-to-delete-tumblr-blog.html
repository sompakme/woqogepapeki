<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>How to delete tumblr blog</h1></header><section class=post-content><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-cant-i-delete-my-tumblr-account></span>Why can’t I delete my Tumblr account?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>You <b>can’t delete</b> your <b>account</b> using the <b>Tumblr</b> app for mobile devices. Deletion is only possible using the <b>Tumblr</b> website. When you <b>delete</b> your <b>account</b>, your primary <b>Tumblr</b> blog is deleted as well. Secondary blogs of which you are the only member are deleted too.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-delete-your-main-blog-on-tumblr></span>Can you delete your main blog on Tumblr?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Each <b>Tumblr</b> user is given a <b>primary blog</b> that will forever be associated with their email address and cannot be <b>deleted</b>. The <b>primary blog</b> cannot be <b>deleted</b> without <b>deleting</b> the user’s other <b>blogs</b>. Secondary <b>blogs can</b> be <b>deleted</b>, though <b>Tumblr</b> has hidden and masked the <b>delete</b> mechanism in the “Members” control panel.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-i-permanently-delete-my-tumblr-account></span>How do I permanently delete my Tumblr account?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Log in to your <b>Tumblr account</b>, and click on the ‘<b>Account</b>‘ icon, which is the person-shaped icon. Select from your list of blogs the one you want to <b>delete</b>. On the iOS app, swipe left on the <b>blog</b> and choose ‘<b>Delete</b>‘. On the <b>Android</b> app, select the gear icon (settings) and chose ‘<b>Delete</b> this <b>Tumblr</b>‘.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-i-delete-a-blog-on-tumblr-without-deleting-my-account></span>How do I delete a blog on Tumblr without deleting my account?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click “<b>Delete</b> [your <b>blog’s</b> name].” If it says “<b>Delete</b> everything” instead, it means that you’re currently on your Primary <b>blog</b> — you can’t <b>delete</b> your Primary <b>blog without deleting</b> your entire <b>account</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happens-if-i-delete-my-main-tumblr-blog></span>What happens if I delete my main Tumblr blog?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Deleting your <b>Tumblr</b> account removes your <b>primary blog</b> and all secondary <b>blogs</b>. After deleting your <b>Tumblr</b> account, the user email address and <b>blog</b> URL you chose for the account will go back into the pool for reuse.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-i-change-my-primary-blog-on-tumblr-2020></span>How do I change my primary blog on Tumblr 2020?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Log into your <b>tumblr</b> account and go to your current <b>Primary blog</b>. Click on Customize theme, then Edit HTML. Right after where it says &lt;head> put the following code, where “http://inserttumblrurl.<b>tumblr</b>.com/” is the address of the Secondary <b>blog</b> that you want to be the <b>Primary blog</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-point-of-a-secondary-blog-on-tumblr></span>What is the point of a secondary blog on Tumblr?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Secondary blogs</b> lack some of the social features used by primary <b>blogs</b>: they are unable to like posts, follow other <b>blogs</b>, or send asks or submissions. However, <b>secondary blogs</b> can be password-protected, requiring a password to view the <b>blog</b>. You can add other <b>Tumblr</b> users to a <b>secondary blog</b> to create a group <b>blog</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-switch-blogs-on-tumblr-mobile></span>How do you switch blogs on Tumblr mobile?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Step 1: On your <b>Tumblr mobile app</b>, click on the user icon on the bottom-right corner to open the account page. Then click on your username on the top-left corner. Step 2: On the drop-down menu, choose a different <b>blog</b> you want to <b>switch</b> or click the Create a new <b>Tumblr</b> button to create a new <b>blog</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-have-two-primary-blogs-on-tumblr></span>Can you have two primary blogs on Tumblr?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Note: <b>If you</b> want to create a new <b>primary blog</b>, <b>you</b>‘ll <b>have</b> to log out of your current account and create a new account <b>with</b> a different email address at <b>tumblr</b>.com/register. There is no way to <b>have two primary blogs</b> associated <b>with one</b> email address.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-switch-accounts-on-tumblr></span>Can you switch accounts on Tumblr?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Multiple <b>accounts</b>: <b>You can</b> now add multiple <b>Tumblr accounts</b> and quickly <b>switch</b> between them without having to log out and log back in.

However, it is possible to create ‘sideblogs’, which are for all intents and purposes additional <b>accounts</b> run by the <b>same email</b> address.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46hprBlpKR6pbHLnqueZaSquqO40WaZpaeXYn9w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./grammys-2023-what-you-didn-t-see-on-tv.html><span>←</span><span>Grammys 2023: What You Didn't See on TV</span></a>
