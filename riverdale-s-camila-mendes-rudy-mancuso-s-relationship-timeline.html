Sometimes, it’s not really worth it.”</p><p>Mancuso, for his part, was previously in a long-term relationship with actress <a href=#><strong>Maia Mitchell</strong></a>.&nbsp;In April 2022, Us Weekly exclusively confirmed that the twosome <a href=#>had called it quits “a few months” prior</a> after six years together.</p><p>Scroll on to relive Mendes and Mancuso’s romance:</p><h3>April 2022</h3><p>“I’m beyond excited to have the wildly gifted mind of Camila join this special journey of Música where we’re telling an authentic Brazilian-American story through the eyes of a synesthete,” Mancuso said in an April 2022 statement about working with his now-girlfriend.</p><h3>September 2022</h3><p>The duo sparked romance rumors after they were photographed arriving at the Venice Film Festival together.
