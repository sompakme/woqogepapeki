But leave it to Selena Gomez to take her dedication to the next level by sharing her entire skincare routine with her followers on TikTok - yawns and all.</p><p>In her TikTok video, Selena revealed her top picks for achieving her signature glowing skin which included the hydrating eye patches from her brand, Rare Beauty.</p><h2 id=selena-gomes-uses-a-skin-care-product-for-people-50-years-old-and-older>Selena Gomes Uses A Skin Care Product For People 50 Years Old And Older</h2><p>We've all heard the adage that you're never too young to start taking care of your skin, and Selena Gomez's skincare pick proves just that. Retinol, a powerful anti-aging active, has been a hot topic in the beauty industry for years, but many people still believe it's only suitable for those with mature skin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Selena's choice of retinol serum shows that there's no right age to start using this game-changing ingredient.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Selena-Gomez-Sparks-New-Sweatpants-Trend-In-Comfy-Night-Out-Look-(1).jpg><p>But what about those pesky issues that come with aging, like wrinkles and age spots? Well, according to many shoppers over 50, incorporating retinol into your skincare routine can seriously benefit mature skin.</p><p>One happy customer even raved that the serum had significantly reduced the appearance of both pores and wrinkles on their face. Another reviewer in their mid-fifties reported that their skin appeared clearer and felt firmer, while most of them called the effects "smoothing magic" and confirmed that the serum worked wonders on their fine lines and wrinkles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/the-things-copySelena-Gomez-Takes-Tech-Entrepreneur-Zen-Matoshi-On-Date-To-Dua-Lipa-Concert.jpg><p>Dermalogica's Dynamic Skin Retinol Serum is a powerful yet lightweight formula that gained popularity among users ages 50 and above with mature skin. It has a high dose of retinoid complex and concentrated squalane for all skin types and issues.</p><p>In simple terms, retinoids and retinol both came from vitamin A, and they work by changing the way our skin cells function. As we age, the natural production of collagen and elastic fibers declines, resulting in thin, fragile skin that is prone to wrinkles and sun damage.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Inside North West’s Friendship With Selena Gomez’s Sister Gracie Teefey</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dermatologist at Stanford University</a>, retinoids and retinol are miracle workers that help boost the production of natural chemicals like hyaluronic acid to keep the skin plump and moist.</p><p>They also stimulate collagen production and prevent the breakdown of existing collagen, which is important for maintaining skin elasticity. And as if that wasn't enough, retinoids also have anti-inflammatory properties that can help to reduce the appearance of acne and other skin blemishes.</p><h2 id=what-is-selena-gomez-39-s-skin-care-routine>What Is Selena Gomez's Skin Care Routine?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong><strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Selena Gomez previously shared her makeup routine</a>, and now she showed her skincare routine which kicks off with the ultimate luxury, La Mer's The Concentrate serum, applied generously to the face. She then swears by Bioderma's Sensibio Cleansing Micellar Water to ensure every trace of makeup is eradicated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Rare Beauty founder is meticulous with her eye makeup removal, she used a baby beauty blender to delicately wipe away any leftover mascara or liner. Next up, Gomez applied Dermalogica Multi-Active Toner, misted onto what appears to be Face Halo's makeup remover pad.</p><p>Then, she chose to nourish her skin with another La Mer product, a luxurious face oil that gives her skin the perfect amount of hydration before putting on moisturizer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/martin-short-selena-gomez-and-steve-martin-at-the-la-premiere-of-only-murders-in-the-building-season-2.jpg><p>Gomez then reaches for Tatcha's The Water Cream to moisturize her skin, then completes the routine with Laneige's Radian-C Cream for an added burst of nourishment. The singer's skincare routine is extensive but highlights the importance of removing makeup thoroughly and taking the time to nourish and hydrate your skin for a radiant glow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-selena-gomez-39-s-most-expensive-skin-care-product>What Is Selena Gomez's Most Expensive Skin Care Product?</h2><p>Selena Gomez is not your average celebrity when it comes to her skincare routine. While most stars opt for cleansing oils to remove their makeup, Selena goes for something a bit more luxe, La Mer's The Concentrate. The full-sized bottle costs about 539 USD (£435) but it's also sold in smaller bottles.</p><p>Although this serum is not for the faint of heart, Selena noted in her video that most of her expensive skin care products were gifted to her and any serum can do the job of removing makeup just as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-truth-about-selena-gomez-s-relationship-with-gracie-elliot-teefey.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, what's the big deal about La Mer's The Concentrate? Well, this serum is designed to help reduce inflammation and combat skin irritation. The most impressive feature of The Concentrate is its ability to strengthen the skin barrier. This unique stabilizing ferment works to bring agitated complexions back from the brink and restore balance to your skin.</p><h2 id=who-are-other-celebrities-who-use-dermalogica-products>Who Are Other Celebrities Who Use Dermalogica Products?</h2><p>The quest for smooth, youthful skin is something that most of us strive for as we age, especially for celebrities who are constantly in the eyes of the public. While there are countless products on the market promising to help achieve this goal, few are as effective as retinoids and retinol.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Everything-To-Know-About-Selena-Gomezs-Dog_-Winnie-And-Daisy.jpg><p>The International Dermal Institute has been creating effective and gentle skincare for every skin type since 1983.
