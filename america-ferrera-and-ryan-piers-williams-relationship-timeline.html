Did you not think I would tell you first?’ And then I put out a statement that it wasn’t true, and that became a whole news story. So now it’s news when something doesn’t happen?

To be completely consumed by the same project and be on set together in the long run becomes quite a bonding experience. When it came to discussing playing a couple in [his movie,&nbsp;<i>X/Y</i>], we thought there would be a built-in intimacy and history in terms of body language — the kind you see in people in a long-term relationship that’s hard to fake.”</p><p class=p1>Keep reading for&nbsp;Ferrera&nbsp;and Williams’ complete relationship timeline:</p><h3 class=p1><b>2005</b></h3><p class=p1>The two USC students met when Williams cast Ferrera in his short film about a string of murders in Juarez, Mexico.
