They come in various shapes, sizes, and colors, and many house plants have unique abilities. For example, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Century Plant</a> can live for more than 100 years and the Voodoo Lily plant can grow from a bulb that was flowering 50 years ago.</p><p>Recent years have seen <a href=#>an explosion in interest in houseplants</a>. While the trend began with easy-to-care-for houseplants suitable for beginners, it has now evolved. Houseplant-obsessed gardeners have grown weary of the regular and ordinary and are now seeking the odd and exceptional.</p><p>Prepare for price shock, as we've compiled a list of the 8 most expensive house plants money can buy.</p><h2 id=philodendron-patriciae>Philodendron Patriciae</h2><p>With its unique features and enticing beauty, this plant is indeed one of <a href=#>the most expensive plants</a> you can buy. Originating in the tropical rainforests of Colombia, this plant has leaflets with a crumpled appearance that can grow to a length of four feet with a noticeable center vein. It is now named for the wife of one of the Missouri Botanical Garden plant researchers who brought the long-leafed Philodendron plant to the world. This "Patrician" is the aristocracy of houseplants, ranging in price from $500 to $2,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=philodendron-spiritus-sancti>Philodendron Spiritus-Sancti</h2><p>Recognized for their heart-shaped leaves, Philodendrons are available in different varieties, and those that are difficult to locate cost exorbitant costs. A single species of this rare, long-leaved Brazilian plant, whose name translates to "spirit of the Holy Ghost," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly sold on eBay for more than $9,600</a>. Due to its rarity, several devotees have turned to buying paper replicas or donning T-shirts bearing the plant's picture.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Trippy Plants We Can't Believe Are Real</a></span></p><h2 id=philodendron-luxurians-choco>Philodendron Luxurians 'Choco'</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The plant takes its title from the western part of Colombia from which it originates, despite the fact that it is not genuinely chocolate-colored, as its name suggests. This philodendron's glossy, white-veined, heart-shaped, deep green leaves end up making it a Valentine's Day gift that does not promote cavities or calorie excess, unlike other forms of pricey "chocolate." However, even a tiny plantlet of this species would cost the giver hundreds of dollars, which might typically buy a bulk of sweets!</p><h2 id=philodendron-billietiae-variegata>Philodendron Billietiae Variegata</h2><p>This cultivar's vivid orange leaf blades are indicative of all Philodendron Billietiae, but its leaves have a unique yellow to white variegation, making it a <a href=#>highly-prized item among dedicated houseplant enthusiasts</a>. Those prepared to spend more than $10,000 may well be obligated to pay for this houseplant Even just a single-rooted Philodendron Billietiae Variegata stem clipping can cost a lot of money.</p><h2 id=monstera-deliciosa-albo-variegata>Monstera Deliciosa Albo Variegata</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Traditionalists who appreciate the appearance of the more traditional Swiss cheese plant, with its bifurcated leaves, may wish to purchase this white-spotted huge cheese. Big specimens of Borsigiana, which is technically a synonym for deliciosa, can cost up to at least $8,000 a piece. The plant can potentially generate 18-inch-wide leaves, but it demands time to evolve, just like real cheese.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Poisonous Plants That Look Edible</a></span></p><h2 id=monstera-obliqua-peru>Monstera obliqua ‘Peru’</h2><p>Gardeners who desire leaves that are 90% absent and look to have been nearly devoured by enormous, ravenous bugs should choose the multicolored and highly fenestrated kind of the window leaf vine. It ranges in price from approximately $200 for simple stems containing nodes to $7,000 for a plantlet in a container. Buyers should be aware that this plant grows over time, has paper-thin leaflets, and necessitates high levels of humidity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=philodendron-joepii>Philodendron Joepii</h2><p>Unlike most Philodendron leaves, which are typically heart-shaped, each leaf of this one of <a href=#>the most unique species of plants</a> seems to have ears on the front, a thin neck, and a broad mouth. Named for the Dutch biologist who spotted it growing on an ant colony in French Guiana in 1991, it is possible that it is a hybrid of two already recognized species. Regardless of its ancestry, this species is too contemporary to be included on the Plant List. A single stem cutting might cost well over $2,000 due to its rarity.</p><h2 id=monstera-adansonii-variegata>Monstera Adansonii Variegata</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Monsteras demand the most colossal prices, with one reportedly selling for almost $38,000 on eBay. This substantial cost does not apply to the standard, solid-green Swiss cheese plant (Monstera Deliciosa), but only to cultivars with "fenestration" as well as white variegation. With each of these characteristics, the Swiss cheese vine known as Adansonii Variegata can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars for a single-rooted clipping of a mature plant. The poor 18th-century French botanist Michel Adanson, after whom the plant is titled, would indeed be amazed!</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>The 8 Most Expensive Things Owned By U2 Frontman Bono<span style=font-weight:400></span></a></span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Spruce</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bobvila</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Money INC</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9OhnKydXZa%2FpnnToZxmcF2ivLTAjJ6vqZ2eqLa3sYyhpq6rlWK9ra3NrapmpZ%2Bjsrp5wpqlZpqlrnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sean-kingston-walks-first-red-carpet-since-accident.html><span>←</span><span>Sean Kingston Walks First Red Carpet Since Accident</span></a>
