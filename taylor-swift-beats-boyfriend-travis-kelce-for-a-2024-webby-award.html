Swift collaborated with the website in September 2023 to register fans to vote ahead of Election Day that year.</p><p>The singer beat out Kelce, who was nominated for his collaboration with The Cheesecake Factory. (The Kansas City Chiefs tight end, also 34, wore an outfit that looked similar to <a href=#>the restaurant’s takeout bags</a> when arriving to an NFL game in January.) The other nominees included Amaury Guichon’s Whimsical Wonka Suitcase, M·A·C COSMETICS x TUBEGIRL and The Ad You Stay In.</p><p>While Travis didn’t nab that award, he and brother <strong>Jason Kelce</strong> took home a separate Webby for Best Co-Hosts, Features (Podcasts). The sibling duo famously host the <a href=#>“New Heights” podcast</a>. (They beat out “Bitch Sesh,” “Jill Scott Presents: J.ill the Podcast,” “Questlove Supreme” and “We Can Do Hard Things.”)</p><p>While the Webby winners have already been announced, there will be an in-person ceremony hosted by <strong>Amber Ruffin</strong> on Monday, May 13, taking place in New York City.</p><p>Since both Swift and Travis have picked up a win, fans are wondering whether the couple will make an appearance at the forthcoming show. While it seems unlikely, as the duo have yet to walk a red carpet together, Swift will also be on the European leg of her <a href=#>Eras Tour</a>. She’s set to perform in Paris from Thursday, May 9 to Sunday, May 12. It’s currently unclear whether Travis will be by her side as she hits the road once again.</p><p>Swift and Travis took their relationship public in September 2023, months after the NFL star discussed her tour on the “New Heights” podcast that July.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“This all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell,” Swift shared during her TIME <a href=#>magazine cover story</a>, published in December 2023. The singer also noted that she and Travis “started hanging out right after that.”</p><p>She went on to say that the duo “had a significant amount of time” together that no one knew about.</p><p>“We got to get to know each other,” she added. “By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple. I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatmamhvLN50rCgn6xdl7KiwNJmmaixlqe2prrDZqurmaaewG63xKWanmWWpL9urYxrZ2tsXayyo67YZpiwmaKZfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./selena-gomez-revealed-a-skin-care-routine-that-people-her-age-are-reluctant-to-use.html><span>←</span><span>Selena Gomez Revealed A Skin Care Routine That People Her Age Are Reluctant To Use</span></a>
