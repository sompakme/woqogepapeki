And throughout her life, she had become the symbol of tenacity, grace, and courage. But she was also a fashion hero, influencing generations to reconsider tweed dresses and colorful outfits. <a href=#>Everything that Her Majesty touched turned to gold</a>. She was a renowned fashion icon, the muse of renowned artists, and the sweetheart of British car enthusiasts.</p><p>In addition to being the only person in Britain permitted to drive without a license, the Queen was also a driving enthusiast and enthusiastic luxury car collector who collected some of the most amazing cars in the world. Given that Her Majesty served as a driving mechanic in the Women's Auxiliary Territorial Service during World War II, it is logical to assume that she is familiar with automobiles. Let’s take a peek inside Queen Elizabeth’s luxury car collection.</p><h2 id=1955-rolls-royce-phantom-iv-state-landaulette>1955 Rolls-Royce Phantom IV State Landaulette</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From 1959 through 2002, Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh used this amazing car. This stunning vehicle, widely recognized as "the most exclusive of post-war Rolls-Royces," was rebuilt to have larger windows so that onlookers can get an excellent view of <a href=#>the Royal family</a>. This model was limited to the production of only 18 units, and it possessed a number of distinctive attributes.</p><p>First, this was the first eight-cylinder production car ever produced by Rolls-Royce. Second, Her Royal Highness Princess Elizabeth bought the initial Phantom IV with chassis number 4AF2. Instead of Hooper & Co., the automaker sent the vehicle for bodywork to H J Mulliner at her request. The British Royal Family would ultimately retain five of these magnificent automobiles.</p><h2 id=bentley-bentayga>Bentley Bentayga</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Obviously, the very first Bentley Bentayga ever produced is in the Queen's collection. The luxurious SUV was custom-built by Bentley per the Queen's specifications. And in a major PR coup, the first person to take delivery was none other than Her Majesty, enjoying new heights of arm-waving luxury from the rear seat.</p><p>It appears that Her Majesty enjoyed driving <a href=#>opulent and powerful SUVs</a> on her hunting excursions. Given that the Bentayga was fitted with a twin-turbocharged 6.0-liter W12 engine that produced 600 horsepower and 664 lb.-ft. of torque, it is reasonable to conclude that this sport utility vehicle could swiftly and comfortably transport the king to all corners of the United Kingdom.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Peek Inside Tennis Superstar Serena Williams' Luxurious Car Collection</a></span></p><h2 id=daimler-empress-mkii>Daimler Empress MkII</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was one of the monarch's earliest automobiles, and she kept it for a considerable amount of time. According to The Sun, the four-door saloon featured "fold-down walnut tables and throne-like seats." The Daimler Empress MkII owned by the Queen was one of 33 manufactured, and it will go into history as an exceedingly exquisite car, ideal for the Royal family and nobility.</p><h2 id=2001-daimler-super-v8-lwb>2001 Daimler Super V8 LWB</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daimler Super V8 LWB</a> is yet another custom-built vehicle constructed for Her Majesty and presented to her in 2001. The Queen traveled a total of 15,242 miles (24,500 kilometers) in this automobile over the course of three years. Under the hood of the Daimler Super V8 LWB was a supercharged 4.0-liter V8 engine that produced 375 horsepower (280 kW).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It also has a sliding armrest holder for the Queen's handbags and flashing strobe lights for emergencies and visibility, as desired by the monarch. Additionally, Daimler eliminated the cigarette lighters and redesigned the ashtray to accommodate the operational security lighting system.</p><h2 id=1961-vauxhall-cresta-pa-friary-estate>1961 Vauxhall Cresta PA Friary Estate</h2><p>It wasn't until the early 1960s that the public caught sight of the Queen behind the wheel of a Vauxhall, which, when one considers the Queen's <a href=#>collection of Bentleys</a> and Jaguars, is somewhat surprising. However, the Vauxhall was ideal for her country lifestyle as well as her passion for the great outdoors. The car was adapted by Vauxhall to include "a dog guard for the corgis, a gun rack for pheasant shoots, and a fishing rod holder built into the roof." In later years, members of the Royal Family chose more Vauxhall automobiles to add to their own collection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Peek Inside Dua Lipa's Insane Car Collection</a></span></p><h2 id=2009-jaguar-x-type-sportwagon-v6-sovereign>2009 Jaguar X-Type Sportwagon V6 Sovereign</h2><p>The first fast estate produced by Jaguar was one of the several vehicles the Queen preferred to drive. This vehicle, equipped with a V6 engine and a dog grille behind the rear seats for the world's most famous pack of Corgis, was the vehicle the Queen drove to church when she was 91 years old.</p><h2 id=range-rover>Range Rover</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The legendary Range Rover</a> has been one of the Queen's most faithful aids over the years. Since 1979, she has driven and owned nearly every iteration of the Rangie. Clearly her favorite vehicle, the Queen had been photographed driving it several times. Land Rover was one of four British corporations to hold a Royal Warrant. The Range Rover has served as a State Review automobile, allowing the Queen to stand on a platform and wave to the public, as well as the Queen's personal vehicle. An automobile for monarchs, if you will.</p><h2 id=1953-land-rover-series-i>1953 Land Rover Series I</h2><p>The Queen has a lengthy relationship with Land Rover. The Series I was the only vehicle capable of traversing the huge Scottish moors surrounding Balmoral Castle. In reality, the Queen and later the Royal family's passion for Land Rovers was largely responsible for the vehicle's continuing association with wealth.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>This Is What Makes ‘The Rings of Power’ The Most Expensive TV Show Ever</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ India</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Car Blog India</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drive Spark</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9OhnGaqn66urXnFpZyerF2WerGxxKRkoqajnrGmedOhnGakkamybr3UnpynZZWhtrutwZ6roWWZnsBuuNSxrKuxXZius3nCqKOlnZOptrC6jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-outrageous-tv-shows-about-rich-people-problems.html><span>←</span><span>10 Outrageous TV Shows About Rich People Problems</span></a>
