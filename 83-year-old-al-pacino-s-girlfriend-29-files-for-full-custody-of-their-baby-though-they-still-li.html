This move paves the way for her to initiate child support proceedings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As indicated by recently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">obtained legal documents from The Blast</a>, Noor filed a petition to establish the parental relationship for her 3-month-old son, Roman Alfallah Pacino.</p><p>Within the filing, Noor was requesting full physical custody of their child, while allowing the Academy Award-winning actor "reasonable visitation" rights. However, she expressed her willingness to grant Pacino joint legal custody in the filing, ensuring his involvement in significant decisions such as education, healthcare, and religion.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Al Pacino Refuse To Work With Keanu Reeves Unless He Took A Significantly Lower Salary Than Him?</a></span></p><p>Notably, Alfallah included a one-page document titled a "voluntary declaration of parentage," which bore the signatures of both parties. This document was executed a mere six days after the child's birth and was endorsed by Al Pacino along with a third-party witness. In essence, this confirms his biological paternity of the child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The new mother also asked the court to compel Pacino to cover any legal expenses or associated costs in connection with this case.</p><h2 id=al-is-still-together-with-his-girlfriend-and-they-rsquo-re-resolving-the-situation-privately>Al Is Still Together With His Girlfriend, And They’re Resolving The Situation Privately</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/untitled-design-89.jpg><p>However, the custody dispute seems to be short-lived. Days after Noor’s petition became public knowledge, it was reported that she’s resolved the situation with Al and the two are still living together, his representative confirmed.</p><p>"Al and Noor have successfully worked together and have mutually reached agreements regarding their child Roman," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Al’s publicist stated to Yahoo</a>. "They are still together."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The new parents have also been seen out together - without their infant – since the custody dispute news broke. As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reported by PEOPLE Magazine</a>, the couple were spotted dining at Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles on the very day the legal documents were submitted. They arrived and departed from the restaurant together, enjoying their meal in the company of another couple.</p><p>Despite earlier reports, Noor’s custody filing may have simply been to establish a legal arrangement for her son’s sake, and not an indication the couple had parted ways, though neither Al nor Noor have commented on the speculation.</p><p>Pacino, who has remained unmarried throughout his life, was initially connected to Alfallah in April 2022, with their relationship developing during the pandemic. This May, Pacino's spokesperson officially announced that Pacino and Alfallah were expecting a child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's worth noting that, behind the scenes, Al expressed surprise at the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pregnancy and requested a paternity test</a>, as reported by TMZ during that period. By June, Pacino openly acknowledge his baby’s impending arrival to the media.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYpWWglrCqus6sZKatk516urvUp56eql2ctrO4xaugnqaUYrOquMSsZJ%2BtnKF6pMHSraadsV2XrqPFjK2fqK2XnXqttdWeZK2nl5rBqbHRaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./7-weirdos-you-ll-see-on-plastics-of-hollywood-and-8-potentials.html><span>←</span><span>7 Weirdos You'll See On Plastics Of Hollywood (And 8 Potentials)</span></a>
