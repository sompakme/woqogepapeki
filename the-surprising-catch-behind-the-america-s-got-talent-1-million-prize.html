However, there’s a catch.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Greatest Acts & Auditions On America's Got Talent 2016 (And 5 Of The Biggest Fails)</a></span></p><p>There’s a disclaimer at the end of every America’s Got Talent episode that says that the $1 million prize is payable in a financial annuity over 40 years. This means that the winner will technically just receive $25,000 every year for the next 40 years.</p><p>Another option for America’s Got Talent winners is to receive the present cash value of such annuity. So, by the time that last year’s winner, Brandon Leakes gets his $1 million prize, he will already be in his 60s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still, thousands of aspiring contestants audition for America’s Got Talent since even non-winners are given a slew of opportunities once they are seen in the program.</p><p>For instance, <a href=#>comic impressionist Melissa Villasenor</a> appeared in America’s Got Talent Season 6. She was a finalist on the program, but she didn’t win the title. Today, she’s a regular on Saturday Night Live.</p><p>Villasenor has also voiced some characters from the Disney hits Ralph Breaks the Internet and Toy Story 4.</p><p>Just like her, <a href=#>classical singer Jackie Evancho</a> is another America’s Got Talent success story. She was a runner-up on Season 5, but she has also been named as the best-selling debut artist of the year and the youngest solo artist to ever go platinum with her debut EP.</p><p>Meanwhile, America’s Got Talent is set to return for its 16th season on June 1.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>People</a> confirmed that Simon Cowell will return to the judges’ chair this season. Last year, he missed multiple live episodes after getting into an accident.</p><p>NBC also confirmed that Howie Mandel, Heidi Klum, and Sofia Vergara will all return as judges. Terry Crews will still host the show.</p><p>Last month, Crews announced that the final virtual open call via the America’s Got Talent website ended on March 6.</p><p>The hit reality TV show will air until August when a new winner is crowned.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>'American Idol' Vs 'The Voice': Which Grand Winner Brings Home More Case</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=#>Newsweek</a>, <a href=#>People</a>, <a href=#>Goldderby</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSurrHRopqaq12cvLV505qjnqakYrSzrc2dZKmqma%2Bybq%2FArZqhZZGcwXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sofia-carson-defends-purple-hearts-amid-viewer-backlash.html><span>←</span><span>Sofia Carson Defends 'Purple Hearts' Amid Viewer Backlash</span></a>
