These are all popular terms, just as smoking joints, blunts, bongs or vaporizers, are also popular terms. Celebrities are no exceptions to using these terms, when openly discussing their marijuana habits. There are many stereotypes that are associated with marijuana use, such as being lazy, unmotivated and loving to eat cereal. Celebrities that openly admit to smoking cannabis challenge those stereotypes, but can also find themselves being scrutinized by the media. These celebrities don't consider marijuana a hard drug like heroin or cocaine, and many of them become pot activists in a way, as they go on shows and discuss their casual cannabis use. Here is a look at 11 celebrities who smoke marijuana.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=11-seth-rogen>11)&nbsp;Seth Rogen</h2><p><a title="Seth Rogen Net Worth" href=#>Seth Rogen</a> is an avid and very open pot smoker.
