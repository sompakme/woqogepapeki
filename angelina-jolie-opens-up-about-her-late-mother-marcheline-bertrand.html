As I talked to Guerlain about the artistry they devote to the making of the perfume and the way they work in communities, sourcing their ingredients, the pieces came together and I felt we were a match.”</p><p>While recalling her late mother, who was also an actress and humanitarian, Jolie shared that Bertrand was a very “natural” woman.</p><span class=caption></span><p>“She never spoiled herself, never wore make-up, and wore modest jewelery, but she always had a few special items for when she wanted to feel like a lady,” she recalled. “One of those special items – and I remember it because it seemed so elegant – was her Guerlain powder (Ladies in All Climates). I think it speaks of all women having those few special things that make them feel feminine. And so when I was a little girl, I would associate Guerlain with that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>For Jolie, who is the mom of six kids with estranged husband <b>Brad Pitt</b>, her go-to product is under eye concealer, she told <i>Hello!,</i> while also admitting that her approach towards aging is to appreciate life.</p><p>“Maybe because my last decade has included many health scares and a focus on raising children, I am simply happy to be healthy, and above all that the children are healthy,” Jolie, who underwent a double mastectomy and later had her ovaries removed in March 2015, said. “There is nothing else to fear.
