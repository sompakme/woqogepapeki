The star released her debut album at the age of 19 and has remained on top of the charts ever since. Whether you have been a fan since the very beginning or fell in love with her most recent release back in 2015, there is no denying just how much of a talent she truly is. Throughout the "Chasing Pavements" singers career, she has undergone <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a number of transformations,</a> one of which has been to her hair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While we all know and love Adele as the blonde that she is, that is surprisingly not her natural hair color at all! The singer has gradually altered her hair throughout the years going from red hair to a more blonde look, which fans have absolutely loved, however, for those of who have only known <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adele </a>as a blonde, the before and after are definitely worth seeing!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>15 Facts About Adele That Have Recently Come To Light</a></span></p><h2 id=blonde-hair-don-t-care>Blonde Hair, Don't Care</h2><p>Adele first stepped out on the scene back in 2008 when the British-born singer released her debut album, "19" at only 19 years old. Adele has kept the trend of naming albums after her age, and it has definitely worked in her favor. Whether you're a fan of "19", "21" or "25", there really is no denying the talent and success she has managed to reach with just 3 albums under her belt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During this time, Adele has managed to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> amass a whopping net worth of $190 million</a>, which is a new figure for the star, after having had to pay ex-husband Simon Konecki nearly 50% of incomes and assets made during their time married together. Since the split, Adele has taken on a brand new outlook on life, losing a reported 40 pounds over the course of the last year, but changes to her look are nothing new for Adele. The singer, who is naturally a redhead, began dying her hair quite early on in her career.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Adele At 32: Here’s Everything She Did To Get In Shape</a></span></p><p>It is safe to say that most of us fell in love with Adele during her natural red hair days, she quickly switched things up after the release of her second album, "21" in 2011. By 2012, the star had officially gone blonde and has stuck with it ever since. While Adele, nor anybody from her team, has ever given a reason behind the style change, it's certainly worked in the singer's favor. Fans were obsessed over the star's new blonde locks, and rightfully so.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adele revealed a brand new hairstyle</a> recently after posting a shot of her posing in front of a Beyonce painting, paying homage to a singer Adele considers to be one of the greatest. The star looked unrecognizable in the best way possible and seems to be the happiest she's ever been. Although Adele as a redhead will forever be how we were introduced to the singer, there really is no style that she can't pull off.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here’s How Adele Maintains Her New Look</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecCdnKWdo2K%2Fpq3LZp%2BaoaJisLC4zq6paA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-10-most-notorious-white-collar-criminals.html><span>←</span><span>The 10 Most Notorious White-Collar Criminals</span></a>
