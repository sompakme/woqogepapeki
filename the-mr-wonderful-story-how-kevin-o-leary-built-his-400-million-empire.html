Also known as 'Mr. 'Wonderful', Kevin's career trajectory impresses with its astonishing diversity, with his knowledgeable outlook in the fields of software and media earning him immense notoriety and fortune. 'Mr. Wonderful' was the co-founder of 'Softkey Software Products', a technology firm aimed at creating software calibrated for family education and entertainment, and was undeniably one of his most notable achievements in <a href=#>his illustrious career</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Softkey's clear-cut business decisions and targeted approach in the technology field led to the firm acquiring several rival organizations such as 'Compton's New Media', 'The Learning Company', and 'Broderbund', making it one of the most influential technology companies in its domain. Softkey would go on to change its name to 'The Learning Company', and its later acquisition by American multinational toy manufacturing and <a href=#>entertainment company Mattel</a> in 1999 would help O'Leary achieve his coveted millionaire status.</p><h2 id=coming-up-with-a-booming-business-idea>Coming Up With A Booming Business Idea</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kevin O'Leary's far-sightedness when it comes to <a href=#>his business decisions</a> would prove immensely fruitful to his software firm. 'Mr. Wonderful', knew that computers and software were on a steady ascend in popularity and requirement, and the high demand for distributors only kept the door for substantial profitability wide open for the Canadian businessman.</p><p>Kevin would utilize his share of SET to give rise to his software firm 'Softkey Software Products' and commence business operations as a distributor of CD-ROM-based computer software for Windows and Mac computers out of his Toronto Basement in 1986.</p><h2 id=walking-a-challenging-path-to-success>Walking A Challenging Path To Success</h2><p>Kevin O'leary's consistency and commitment when it came to developing his <a href=#>business venture speaks volumes</a> of the Canadian entrepreneur's eternal quest to be the top dog in the software domain.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Leading up to the 90s, Softkey would encounter stiff competition from various other software companies and would have to work overtime to prove its superiority in the segment. However, the software firm persevered and would eventually adapt and develop itself enough to dish out a host of educational software products targeted at home users.</p><p>The mid-90s would prove to be <a href=#>quite memorable for Kevin O'Leary</a>, as his software firm would turn into a household name in the educational software industry. The tremendous success of Softkey would help the firm acquire several rival software companies and would go on to dominate the market to become one of Canada's fastest-growing companies.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Shark Tank: How Did The Sharks Get So Wealthy?</a></span></p><h2 id=a-milestone-achieved-attaining-the-millionaire-status>A Milestone Achieved: Attaining The&nbsp;Millionaire Status</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Softkey's established stance in the software industry would eventually help 'Mr. Wonderful' <a href=#>achieve his millionaire status</a>. The software firm's sheer dominance in the segment was quickly noticed by American multinational toy manufacturing and entertainment firm 'Mattel', which would acquire Softkey for a whopping $4.2 billion in 1999.</p><p>'Mr. Wonderful' was on top of his game at this point, with his firm acquiring him a wealthy man. Kevin's near-immediate departure from the firm after its acquisition proved to be hugely unprofitable for Mattel, thereby exemplifying O'Leary's superior business mindset and decision-making abilities.</p><h2 id=emerging-as-an-established-business-typhoon>Emerging As An Established Business Typhoon</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the enormous success of Softkey, Kevin would go on to become a co-investor and director at 'StorageNow Holdings', a Canadian developer of climate-controlled storage facilities. The business idea proved to be immensely profitable, with the firm becoming the operator of multiple storage services in Canada.</p><p>StorageNow was on the radar of several established players in the segment, with the eventual purchase of the Canada-based firm by Storage REIT for a mind-boggling $110 million only doing wonders for Kevin's wealth.</p><p>Kevin would liquidate his shares of the company for a staggering $4.5 million, with the immense fortune and notoriety of <a href=#>the Canadian entrepreneur</a> only getting stronger with each business venture that he chose to associate with.</p><h2 id=becoming-a-popular-television-personality>Becoming A Popular Television Personality</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kevin O'Leary's meteoric rise to the top of the summit of success encompasses a clear business mindset and tremendous decision-making abilities. The highly-accomplished Canadian businessman would <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">eventually try his hand at television</a>, with his notable appearances as an investor on the critically acclaimed American reality television series 'Shark Tank' only accentuating his tremendous financial success.</p><p><a href=#>The hit television series</a> serves as a medium for budding entrepreneurs to secure an investment via a panel of investors that would help boost their business through their connections and would, in turn, serve as consultants, financial advisors, or even partners in the developing business venture.</p><p>Kevin's keen eye for a sustainable business idea has only helped boost his personal wealth that much more, with the Canadian businessman securing over 40 deals with sizable investments across 131 episodes of <a href=#>Shark Tank</a> since his association with the show from 2014.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kevin O'Leary is undeniably one of the most accomplished entrepreneurs in the world. The Canadian business typhoon and investor has amassed a gargantuan fortune over the years, with his clear-cut business decisions, superior intellect, and a keen eye for sustainable business ventures, exemplifying his stance as one of the most seasoned knowledgeable businessmen the world over. Kevin's contribution to the software industry, as well as his critically acclaimed decisions as a venture capitalist, are lauded by a worldwide audience, and 'Mr. Wonderful's fortune could very well snowball more in the near future.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Shark Tank: Net Worth Of Every Shark, Ranked</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Success Bug</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Financhill</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Street</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMpqlmr5%2Bjsaa%2Bxa6jZqukpL%2B6eceormajlau2r3nOpZyaqqlir7a1y61koaGjYoFxfIymoKWkmaS7brHMqaCrnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robert-downey-jr-paid-for-armie-hammer-to-go-to-rehab.html><span>←</span><span>Robert Downey Jr. Paid For Armie Hammer To Go To Rehab</span></a>
