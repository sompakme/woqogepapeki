I don’t know, why don’t we see? San Francisco, would you please welcome No. 30, Mr. <a href=#><strong>Steph Curry</strong></a>!”</p><p>Curry, 35, is a longtime fan of Paramore and displayed his adoration by wearing one of the band’s hoodies. “Us and Steph, we go back a few years, and tonight is our reunion,” Williams explained. “From the moment Steph gets the mic, this is no longer a Paramore show, this is a Steph Curry show.”</p><p>Williams was not kidding, as Curry really leaned into his role as a temporary rock star. “He knows every word,” one fan marveled via Twitter on Tuesday, August 8. “He sounds amazing. steph curry is a paramore fan, this is too much for my heart i simply must ascend to another plane of existence now.”</p><p>Steph’s wife, <a href=#><strong>Ayesha Curry</strong></a>, was at the show as well and shared a few snaps from the evening via her Instagram Stories. “We listened to Paramore on one of our first dates … and many years later they were kind enough to perform at his 30th,” she wrote alongside a video of her husband hanging out near the stage. “This is SO FREAKING COOL! What a full circle moment. Thank you @paramore and [Hayley Williams] … ‘still into you’ took the night for us. Honestly, one of the coolest nights.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Steph-Curry-Surprises-Crowd-With-Performance-at-Paramore-Show-2.jpg><p>Steph and Ayesha, 34, tied the knot in July 2011 <a href=#>after meeting as teenagers</a>.

Williams previously revealed that she turned down a collaboration with the rapper, 28, before she and the band took a break from performing.</p><p>“I literally wrote him back on Instagram and I was like, ‘Buddy, I love you so much, but I don’t want to be that famous,’” Williams said during a 2020 interview with Apple Music’s <strong>Zane Lowe</strong>. “I told him, like, we were getting ready to take a break. I obviously had a lot of issues going on that no one really knew about and I was like, ‘Bro, I just need to disappear. I don’t want to be that kind of a famous person.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqtnaCdeqTB0auwZqulp72ztdKeqmaboqTEpXnWoquhZaCav6e70aaYp5uVYq61ec%2BaqZqln6eybr%2FHqK5o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./skier-saves-snowboarder-full-video-heroic-display-of-kindness.html><span>←</span><span>Skier Saves Snowboarder Full Video Heroic Display Of Kindness</span></a>
