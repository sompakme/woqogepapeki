It was surprising to see <a href=#>Warren Buffett</a> completely bail on his stocks from Dollar General in this economy. You would think that in a down economy people would be spending more time at the Dollar Store trying to get good deals.</p><p><a href=#>When Buffett </a>sold his Dollar General Stock in November of 2012, you can see a drastic drop from 50 Dollars a share to 44 Dollars a share in the matter of weeks.</p><p>This shouldn't be of too much concern though. Dollar General is now being traded at almost 49 Dollars a share. It was hit pretty hard by Buffett cashing out, but now it is almost right back to where it started.</p><p>You can see a fairly rapid growth in Dollar General in the last 3 years. In 2010 Dollar General was trading in the 20s and now has almost tripled. Even though <a href=#>Warren Buffet </a>cashed out, Dollar General looks like a pretty safe investment for the near future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmm62jnrumv9Jorpqqopq7bq7Un52erKRiwKa4y6xkqK2kYrynecClo2anlmK1qr%2BMnaalpJGneqixzZ6pnpmcYsC1u8KkZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tracee-ellis-ross-issa-rae-erika-alexander-cover-essence-magazine.html><span>←</span><span>Tracee Ellis Ross, Issa Rae, Erika Alexander Cover ESSENCE Magazine</span></a>
