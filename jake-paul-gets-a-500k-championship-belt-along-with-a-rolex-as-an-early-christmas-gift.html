The two American-born social media influencers have been dominating the Youtube platform with their risky stunts, sexually suggestive content, and a 'You Only Live Once' attitude. But although a large portion of their renown can be credited to their social media presence, in recent years, they have carried their influence and following from YouTube into the contact sports arena, namely boxing and mixed martial arts. <a href=#>The Disney Channel</a> star, Jake Paul, began his professional boxing career in 2018 by taking on British YouTuber, Deji Olatunji, who he successfully defeated. Jake's victory would mark the beginning of a new area of influence he would set his eyes on boxing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jake 'The Problem Child' Paul and Tyrone 'The One' Woodley have a history of bad blood. One is a complete newbie to combative contact sports who has thus far shocked the world of boxing <a href=#>(as well as his brother, Logan Paul, who fought against Floyd Mayweather)</a>, and the other is a former UFC MMA fighter-turned-boxer. Woodley held a professional MMA career with 19 wins and 7 losses. But despite his experience, he lost his first boxing match to Jake Paul back in August by split decision. Since then, he has vowed to avenge himself against the younger, fresher boxer in Jake Paul. But Jake is set out to prove, for a second time, that he will be dominant against the UFC welterweight champion.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Beating The Odds: How Jake Paul Became The Third Highest-Paid Boxer In The World</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an article posted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, Paul brags about being the favorite against Woodley after receiving an early Christmas gift in the form of a 'Most Valuable Boxer' belt worth $500,000. At a press conference on December 16th, Paul flashed the one-of-a-kind champion belt designed by the famous <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York City</a> street artist, Alec Monopoly. The belt consists of a few pricey items attached to its design that caused such a weighty price tag, such as a stitched on Hermes Birkin bag worth $40K, as well as a Rolex and a Cartier, watch intricately woven in.</p><p>This, of course, adds more sensation to the fight. And as every boxer who has a belt is aware, there is always a contender ready to snatch their title. So this high-priced and authentic trophy champion belt will act as an incentive for the once-defeated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tyron Woodley to prove to himself, Jake, and the MMA and boxing world why he is called "The One."</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Earlier in June, PPV king Floyd 'Money' Mayweather scheduled an exhibition fight with YouTube king, Jake Paul. The matchup of an amateur boxer like Jake Paul against a 50-0 legend like Floyd Mayweather is a testament, not to Jake's superior boxing ability, but a strategic move of two highly influential personalities putting on a show for an easy payday!</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>Logan And Jake Paul Could Make Millions In Potential Boxing Match&nbsp;</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox Sports</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS3orfEZqearZxitKbA0maYZm1gZbhur8eapKmhn6PAqbXPZpmepKRirq27zaBksKGknXqiedGoo56wXZbAbq3NZpyaqpyueqS00aKqraWRqHqotcWtZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-colin-hanks-explained-coronavirus-to-kids-after-tom-s-diagnosis.html><span>←</span><span>How Colin Hanks Explained Coronavirus to Kids After Tom's Diagnosis</span></a>
