We get to see inside the lives of people who more often than not are living much more luxurious lives than we are. We like to see how they lead these glamorous lifestyles, which we long to live ourselves. Between The Hills which gave us a peek into a glamorous lifestyle in the fashion world and The Real Housewives of…well any city, we can’t seem to get enough of peeking into the windows of other people’s lives. It’s fascinating in a sick and depraved way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The problem however with watching reality TV is that sometimes it’s not like reality at all. We love watching the lives of reality stars unfold because it’s actually a lot of fun, but producers of the show have been known to change things a bit to spice the show. Watching real life can be boring at times, after all, nobody has exciting moments in their life every minute of the day. So producers would make up wild stories to keep viewers hooked onto the show. One of the things they like to make up and promote are relationships. We invest ourselves into these people’s lives only to find out the relationships were fake all along. We like to believe in these relationships, and when we find out they aren’t real, it’s saddening. Check out these reality TV relationships that turned out to be fake.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=15-brody-jenner-amp-kristin-cavalleri><strong>15. Brody Jenner & Kristin Cavalleri</strong></h2><p>Laguna Beach and The Hills were hugely popular shows that escalated many of the main character’s careers. After all, that’s where <a href=#>Lauren Conrad</a> got her big break, and now she’s a fashion designer as well as an author. Since the show Kristin Cavallari has been talking about the fake aspects of the show, not worrying a bit about spilling the secrets. She mentioned how there were fights on the show that were faked as well as relationships. One such relationship was the one that she was in with <a href=#>Brody Jenner</a>. She stated that their relationship was just an act on the show and that he had another girlfriend off air the whole time. She did, however, confess that she had a fling with Jenner once but that was well before The Hills was even in existence. “They pretended that he and Jayde broke up, and I was dating Brody, and Jayde and I got into a huge fight because she saw us in a club. It wasn’t real at all. They were together the entire time.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-lauren-conrad-amp-stephen-colletti><strong>14. Lauren Conrad & Stephen Colletti</strong></h2><p>Lauren Conrad was a huge star on the reality TV shows The Hills, as well as Laguna Beach. She went from being a nobody to a reality star. No big deal right? She had the show to thank for her amazing post-reality TV career. During the show she was connected with a guy named <a href=#>Stephen Colletti </a>who was her onscreen boyfriend. Their romance seemed to be the sweetest relationship ever and the stars were genuinely happy. The show has now been off the air for over ten years, and the stars aren’t keeping the secrets any longer. The show portrayed the couple in a love triangle situation with Kristin Cavallari, and she has already been outspoken about the lies on the show. “One of the most hurtful things they did was pressure Stephen to spend time with another girl from the show, Lauren, while he and I were dating. It certainly provided some juicy conflicts, but it also affected me deeply.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=13-jojo-fletcher-amp-chad-johnson><strong>13. JoJo Fletcher & Chad Johnson</strong></h2><p>Chad Johnson was immediately cast as the bad guy during the Bachelorette. He was there for the sole purpose of winning the heart of JoJo Fletcher, but he spent most of his time fighting with the other men on the show. He was considered to be a genuinely terrible human being because he was so mean to everyone. Viewers believed that he was a wolf in sheep’s clothing, only on the show to get media attention and become the next Bachelor. Unfortunately, his plan backfired, and he didn’t even make it halfway through the show. He did something right though because throughout all the seasons he’s been the most talked about villain out there. It’s unfortunate that so many people go on the show with no real interest in connecting with another person but only have fame in their eyes. Although the show can be ridiculous sometimes, the girls always seem to be genuinely trying to seek out love.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=12-audrina-patridge-amp-justin-bobby><strong>12. Audrina Patridge & Justin Bobby</strong></h2><p>It seems as if The Hills had quite a bit of fake relationships going on. It makes you wonder if there was any truth to the series at all. Many of the relationships on the show were completely invented by the producers of the show, and it’s weird that they wouldn’t just allow nature to take its course. On The Hills, <a href=#>Audrina Patridge</a> was portrayed as the girl next door; she was one of the more “innocent” characters on the series and of course they had to set her up with a self-proclaimed bad boy, Justin Bobby. It’s an overused relationship hook that always seems to work in TV shows. Although they appeared to be the real deal on the show their relationship was also fake. Audrina explained that the two were just really good friends and that the chemistry that was shown between them was all editing done by the producers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=11-lauren-conrad-and-brody-jenner><strong>11. Lauren Conrad and Brody Jenner</strong></h2><p>As with most shows that go on for years, it almost seems as if friends are just swamping around their boyfriends. Sorry ladies, but it’s true. We were all rooting for Lauren and Brody, however; they just seemed to be the perfect couple. He was hot, and they had some pretty intense chemistry; we all wanted them to get together. It was all a ruse, however, a coupling that the producers thought up. In fact, it was all based off of what they believed the viewers wanted. They kept things going until 2014 when Brody decided to spill the beans. That was a devastating blow for viewers who really wanted the couple to be together. He made it perfectly clear that he and Lauren were never together, that they were only ever just friends. It was an awkward circumstance because they had to pretend a dating relationship that they never were in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-kim-kardashian-amp-kris-humphries><strong>10. Kim Kardashian & Kris Humphries</strong></h2><p>It’s not surprising to think that there are aspects of Keeping Up with the Kardashians that are fake. The entire family seems really fake so adding fake storylines to the show isn’t a big stretch. Apparently, the relationship between <a href=#>Kim </a>and <a href=#>Kris</a> wasn’t as it seemed. Yes, they were married, but when things began to get rocky for them, their relationship was not depicted as truth on TV. The producer on the show, Russell Jay stated that there were many scenes in a lot of the episodes that were purposely shot to make Kris seem far worse than he actually was. Kris often said that he was shown as the villain even though most of the stuff that was shown was either reshot or edited in such a way that he couldn’t help but look bad. Their marriage was certainly on the rocks, and they eventually divorced, but the fact that Kris was depicted as such a bad guy proved that the show just wanted to provide drama and not depict the truth of the situation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=9-walter-jackson-amp-kenya-moore><strong>9. Walter Jackson & Kenya Moore</strong></h2><p>Kenya Moore is a reality star from The Real Housewives of Atlanta. She was one character that always seemed to be on the bad end of love; she never seemed to be able to catch a break. Her life on the show seemed to be one train wreck of a relationship after another. It was almost painful to watch. In 2012, the star was dating a man by the name of Walter Jackson. It was another relationship that seemed to fizzle out fast, and in 2014, Walter exposed their relationship as a fake. He explained to the media that Kenya had asked him to pretend to be her boyfriend for the sake of the show. “Kenya is a great actress; you have to give her that. She’s very good entertainment, and the viewers want to tune in and watch what she’s going to do or say next, but nothing you see is real, I mean come on, does anyone actually believe what she says anymore?”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-the-bachelorette-s-chris-bukowski><strong>8. The Bachelorette’s Chris Bukowski</strong></h2><p>Many people have wondered whether the love affairs of the Bachelorette show are actually real. After all, these people manage to fall in love and get engaged in only a matter of weeks. It’s crazy to think that it would be real. During the season 8 of the Bachelorette, one of the contestants returned to the show for season 10. Chris made a surprise appearance carrying roses to give to Andi Dorfman, and the show claimed they had no idea that he was going to show up to woo her. Later on, however, Chris admitted during an interview that the whole thing had been set up by producers; it wasn’t even his idea to show up. They even gave him the roses he would need to bring to her. So the romantic gesture turned out to not be so romantic after all. It makes you wonder if any of those marriages are legit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=7-rachel-truehart-amp-nick-peterson><strong>7. Rachel Truehart & Nick Peterson</strong></h2><p>The Bachelor franchise was at it again with another reality TV scandal. In 2012, viewers were introduced to Nick Peterson, and as they got to know him on the show, there were mixed views on him. The general vote was that he was a master manipulator or just a douchebag. Many didn’t believe that he had a true interest in Rachel Truehart; he just seemed a little too sleazy. The truth about him was revealed at the end of the season when Nick was asked whether or not he planned on sharing the prize of $250,000 with Rachel. He declined, shocking viewers everywhere. He decided that he would rather just play a game then find true love even though the couple had agreed to share the money. “I saw the things she said about me behind my back, and I believe that justified me keeping the money.”</p><h2></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-kris-jenner-amp-bruce-jenner><strong>6. Kris Jenner & Bruce Jenner</strong></h2><p>Many people believed that there was something off about the marriage between <a href=#>Kris</a> and <a href=#>Bruce</a>. After all, how do you explain that a wife doesn't know that her husband was struggling with his sexuality? Two people who are married know everything about each other, and you get to know your spouse better than anyone else. Wouldn’t there have been some serious red flags that Kris would have picked up on? The marriage certainly was “real” at one point, after all, they did get married for a reason, but after awhile during the many seasons of Keeping up with the Kardashians, their marriage was clearly problematic. Rumors started flying about how much Kris really knew about her husband’s sexuality. Bruce ended up getting a home of his own, stating that he just needed some space, but it turned out that he needed some time to become Caitlyn Jenner. It seemed as if the union between them was a façade since they rarely spent time together after being married for 23 years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-liz-jannetta-amp-jon-gosselin><strong>5. Liz Jannetta & Jon Gosselin</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Jon Gosselin</a> was portrayed as a despicable human being while he was married to<a href=#> Kate Gosselin</a> especially during the end of their marriage. Kate has stated that since their divorce he has rarely spent any time with his eight children and some of the older children have no interest in seeing him. When the two were divorced, there was no need for him to be on the show any longer. So the show went from Jon and Kate Plus 8&nbsp;to&nbsp;Kate, Plus 8. Jon, however, wasn’t ready to give up the fame that he got from the show. He was to be on the show Couple's Therapy and wanted his then-girlfriend, Hailey Glassman to join him in seeking out fame once again. When she refused, he went and grabbed a fake girlfriend by the name of Liz Jannetta who was more than happy to grab some limelight with him.</p><h2 id=4-brian-dawe-amp-farrah-abraham><strong>4. Brian Dawe & Farrah Abraham</strong></h2><p>There seems to be so many relationships that are on reality TV that isn't real at all. It’s disappointing, to say the least. On the show Couple's Family, it seems to be no different. At the time <a href=#>Farrah Abraham</a> was set to go on the show with her boyfriend, Brian Dawe. During the show, the couple was portrayed as a couple that was trying to make their relationship work despite many problems. It was all an act however just like so many others. Before the show even aired the couple broke up and Brian Dawes wanted to pull out of the whole show. There were serious legal ramifications to a decision like that, but Dawes didn’t seem to care. “I decided my morals and integrity were worth more than any amount of money. I stepped out of the security line [at the airport] and made a life-changing decision to stand up for what I believe in and turn down the check I would be receiving for my appearance on this show.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=3-caitlyn-jenner-amp-candis-cayne><strong>3. Caitlyn Jenner & Candis Cayne</strong></h2><p>It seems as if Bruce Jenner had fake relationships when he was a man as well as when he became a woman. After he had become a woman, Caitlyn, he started seeing another transitioned person by the name of Candis Cayne. Caitlyn has her own show now, I Am Cait, and it was there that she played out this relationship that turned out to be fake from the start. The show took a hit after rumors started flying that the couple was faking their love affair. It turned out that Cait was only introduced to Candis after she had been cast on the show. What seemed like a match made in Heaven, producers admitted that it was a ruse. “Caitlyn didn’t just meet all of these already famous transgender people by accident…they were cast and, yes, they are getting paid.” After the scandal had broken, Candis admitted during an interview that the two were just friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2-jef-holm-amp-emily-maynard><strong>2.&nbsp;Jef Holm & Emily Maynard</strong></h2><p>One of the sweetest couples in reality TV history were Jef Holm and Emily Maynard from Bachelor Nation. They were the kind of couple that everyone was rooting for. They were beautifully matched and viewers loved the fact that Emily was a single mother who had a great heart. She was searching for love and viewers wanted desperately for her to find it. When the show ended Emily had chosen Jef to be her husband and viewers were right on board with her. However, the love between them certainly didn’t last very long. The relationship started souring after rumors of infidelity between both of them. What started off as a perfect love story was crumbling quickly. What made things worse was when Jef’s ex-girlfriend told US Weekly that the relationship was a joke, nothing more than a business deal for Jef. The two broke up in an ugly spat with rumors filtering that Emily paid Jef to keep quiet about what really happened between them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-tenley-molzahn-amp-joshua-albers><strong>1. Tenley Molzahn & Joshua Albers</strong></h2><p>The Bachelor franchise seems to be riddled with scandals and broken hearts. Does anyone ever really find true love on the show? During the show, Bachelor in Paradise, the union between Tenley Molzahn and Joshua Albers was fake from the get-go. One or both of them was out for the money, and of course, the fame sure didn’t hurt either. Rumor has it that the scheme was the mind child of Tenley, that she had never been interested in finding love, she just wanted to be on TV. Poor Joshua seemed to have been the one played this time, and his heart was broken when things ended between them. According to sources Tenley never had any intention of spending any time with Joshua once the show was over. “She was never going to continue a relationship with Josh outside of this show—but she sure made him think she would.”</p><p><strong>Sources</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=#>www.inquisitr.com</a>;&nbsp;<a href=#>www.refinery29.com</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKCfmLiqusZoaG5lopqurbXTsmStrl2nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr20ediorGamlauys3nKp5ywZaeav6Z5xZqinmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-best-early-labor-day-beauty-deals-at-amazon.html><span>←</span><span>15 Best Early Labor Day Beauty Deals at Amazon</span></a>
