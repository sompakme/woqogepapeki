Over the years, the city's reputation as <a href=#>a significant producer of coffee</a>, plastic, fabrics, and food and as a center of Ethiopian culture and trade has increased.</p><p>The rent is 50% less expensive than in New York, with a two-bedroom apartment costing approximately $200 outside the city. In Los Angeles, a ticket to a popular film costs $3.66, compared to $10 in New York City. Addis Ababa, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a magnificent East African city</a> brimming with economy and social development, is a terrific place to live affordably and in luxury.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=vietnam>Vietnam</h2><p>Via Pexels, Loifotos</p><p>Vietnam, then one of the world's poorest nations, has grown and evolved as a nation during the past three decades. In Vietnam's most expensive cities, such as Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, a monthly budget of $1,500 is sufficient for two individuals to live extremely comfortably.</p><p>The average monthly cost for a single person, excluding rent, is $439, and if you have a higher budget, you may live luxuriously in the Asian nation for substantially far less than the United States.</p><h2 id=malaysia>Malaysia</h2><p>Via Pexels, Umar Mukhtar</p><p>In Batu Ferringhi, Malaysia, one may rent a luxurious beach house with three bedrooms and a view of the water for as little as $403 per month. The country is the epitome of beach living, with sandy shores at your doorstep.</p><p>If a traveler was injured and required hospitalization while visiting the country, their medical bill was only $43, a significant difference from an emergency room price in the United States. By <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">relocating to Malaysia</a>, you may turn every day into a beach holiday without ever leaving your garden.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Countries That Pay The Highest Salary To Ex-Pats</a></span></p><h2 id=managua-nicaragua>Managua, Nicaragua</h2><p>Via Pexels, ROBERTO ZUNIGA</p><p>While Nicaragua is the second-poorest nation in the world, the capital city of Managua is home to large enterprises such as Walmart. It is a financial center, and many foreigners retire and settle there permanently from outside the United States.</p><p>The average rent for a two-bedroom apartment is $800, and the average living cost for a single individual is approximately $540. In Managua, a liter of gas costs only $1.23, and the living costs are 58% lower than in New York. Be mindful that Managua has a high crime rate, and conduct research before relocating there.</p><h2 id=mexico>Mexico</h2><p>Via Pexels, Ricardo Esquivel</p><p>Mexico has risen in popularity among retirees seeking affordable luxury living and <a href=#>high-quality healthcare</a>. A couple of retirees may live rent-free in Cancun for between $1,500 and $3,000 per month, which is 85% less than the rent in New York. The monthly cost of living for a single person would be roughly $494.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The nation has been attempting to further improve its healthcare system and is implementing programs to assist senior citizens. With a diversity of tropical climes, Mexico offers low-cost living without sacrificing luxury amenities.</p><h2 id=panama>Panama</h2><p>Via Pexels, Luis Quintero</p><p>Panama, the sole First World metropolis in Central America, provides international luxury living without being too distant from the United States. A beachfront condo in Panama City costs approximately $1,500 per month, while rent, utilities, food, and entertainment cost approximately $2,600 per month.</p><p>Outside of Panama City's <a href=#>tourist-filled coastlines</a>, the price of living is considerably lower. Panama has one of the strongest programs for retirees in the world, therefore ex-pats seeking a permanent home may be found all throughout the country.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Countries With Surprisingly Cheap Internet In The World</a></span></p><h2 id=la-paz-bolivia>La Paz, Bolivia</h2><p>Via Pexels, Roly Vasquez</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In comparison to New York, rent in La Paz, Bolivia is 89.5% less expensive on average.
