The incident occurred on Wednesday (Nov. 29) as Lennox opened up for <a href=# id=auto-tag_rod-wave data-tag=rod-wave>Rod Wave</a>. As she performed “Pressure,” someone from the audience launched a water bottle and hit her. Ari wasn’t pleased by the “fan” engagement and unloaded on the audience. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Dreamville crooner </a>even challenged the perpetrator to a fight.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Bi**h, I’ll f**k you up! Who the f**k did it? Who the f**k did it? I’ll f**k y’all a** up. ‘Cause I don’t play that, I don’t feel that bullsh*t,” she told the crowd. “I will f**k y’all sh*t all the way the f**k up! Don’t you ever disrespect a beautiful Black woman on the stage like that! I’m a f**king f**k you up. That’s the f**k right. Who did it, bi**h?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Right, come here, bi**h. Come here, let’s do it. Come here bi**h, you a pu**y. That’s right, you could never even be as good as a pu**y. That’s right, bi**h. You’re dumb. You’re weak,” she added.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As her rant concluded, security ushered <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the “Get Close” artist</a> away. At that point in the performance, Ari’s microphone had been disconnected. Lennox has yet to comment on the situation.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">2023 has been riddled with audiences throwing objects at artists on stage. <a href=# id=auto-tag_latto data-tag=latto>Latto</a> was<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;hit with an object</a>&nbsp;during her Rolling Loud set in July. The rap star was performing her hit single “Put It On Da Floor” when the incident occurred. Latto pressed the offender during the show.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“You’ll get your a** beat,” the Georgia native warned while dancing along to the song. “Throw it again. Throw it again. I’ll beat your a**. Throw it again,” she repeated before resuming her set.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a href=# id=auto-tag_cardi-b data-tag=cardi-b>Cardi B</a> was&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>splashed with a drink</a>&nbsp;on stage later that month. While performing her 2017 hit, “Bodak Yellow,” a woman can be seen in a video clip tossing her drink on Cardi before the Bronx native reacted. However, Cardi didn’t threaten the person—she hit them with her microphone.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>TMZ</a>&nbsp;reported that the woman struck by the mic reported the altercation to Las Vegas Metro Police Department, intending to press charges. Several videos show that Bardi only threw the object&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>in retaliation</a>. The outlet also noted that the mic allegedly hit the person it was intended for, and a bystander, but it’s unclear which one went to the authorities. The rapper was then<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>&nbsp;cleared of any charges</a>&nbsp;in August.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5a%2FqnnLnqWnp6hitLCx0mamn55dnba1edaaq56qXZe8tcDLnmRqamNphXOAk25uaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-the-cast-of-love-island-usa-2022-did-before-their-reality-show-fame.html><span>←</span><span>What The Cast Of Love Island USA 2022 Did Before Their Reality Show Fame</span></a>
