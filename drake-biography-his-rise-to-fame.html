He's released several records today and has become a household name with the popularity of his music. He's grossed millions of dollars and has sold millions of albums, making him one of the most successful recording artists today.</p><h2 id=drake-s-childhood-and-growing-up><strong>Drake's Childhood and Growing Up</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sandi and Dennis Graham welcomed Aubrey Drake Graham into the world on October 24, 1986 in Toronto, Ontario. His mother was a teacher while his father was a drummer who worked with many different musicians. When he was only five years old his parents decided to get a divorce, which resulted in him living in the west end of Toronto with his mother for several years.</p><p>When Drake turned six his mother made the move to a wealthy Forest Hill area, which she struggled to afford. During this time Drake attended a Jewish day school because his mother is Jewish. Drake later ended up attended both Forest Hill Collegiate Institute as well as Vaughan Road Academy. He dropped out of both of these schools, but he did eventually graduate in late 2012.</p><p>When Drake would visit his father in Memphis, Tennessee, he lived a completely different life than he did in Toronto. One visit he actually saw his father get arrested, which strained the already broken relationship they had even further. His father spent several years in jail, which meant he didn't play a very active role with Drake's childhood. Drake has stated that everything he experienced during his child gave him character and made him into the man he is today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=drake-s-career><strong>Drake's Career</strong></h2><p>Drake got his first big break when he got the role of Jimmy Brooks in the Canadian television show, Degrassi: The Next Generation. Although this didn't pay much money, it was enough to help him and his mother struggle through her being ill without any money coming in. He was also able to land small roles in movies and other television shows, which helped push his name out into the open.</p><p>Drake created a mixtape that he released himself in 2006. He was able to advertise this single on TeenNick, which eventually led to him creating a music video that was played on BET. After two years, Drake was starting to gain more recognition for his music and was even invited to tour with Lil Wayne. Despite his growing success and popularity, he was still not signed and continued to work with artists including: <a title="Rihanna Net Worth" href=#>Rihanna</a>, <a title="Jay-Z Net Worth" href=#>Jay-Z</a>, <a title="Kanye West Net Worth" href=#>Kanye West</a>, <a title="Mary J.

Blige</a> and many others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He finally signed a record deal with Young Money Entertainment on June 29, 2009, after he had success with two top ten songs in the same week. After signing with this record label, Drake went on tour with Lil Wayne, where he fell on stage and injured his knee. After going through rehabilitation, Drake was able to continue releasing music as he collaborated with new artists.</p><h2 id=drake-s-albums-and-music><strong>Drake's Albums and Music</strong></h2><p>Thank me Later was Drake's first official album, which was released in June of 2010. Almost 450,000 albums were sold the very first week it was released, making it one of the most successful rap albums of all time. Take Care was Drake's next album, which was released in October 2011.

Records, taking his career to the next level.</p><h2 id=how-much-drake-makes><strong>How Much Drake Makes</strong></h2><p>Drake's net worth is currently at $30 million dollars, but this number will rise in the future as he releases more singles and continues to collaborate with new artists. In 2012 he grossed just over $42 million dollars from the Club Paradise Tour, which may take place again in the future.
