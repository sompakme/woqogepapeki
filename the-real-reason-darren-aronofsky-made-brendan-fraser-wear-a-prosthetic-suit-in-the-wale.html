Although Brendan Fraser’s acting in this movie has been highly praised, there has also been plenty of criticism for having the actor use a prosthetic suit to play the leading role in this film.</p><p>The director of the film has recently responded to this criticism and defended the choice of casting Brendan Fraser in The Whale.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Best Brendan Fraser Roles To Watch Before We See His Major Comeback In The Whale</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-brendan-fraser-rsquo-s-career-went-downhill>How Brendan Fraser’s Career Went Downhill</h2><p>Despite starring in numerous successful movies, by the late 2000s, Brendan Fraser’s career took a turn for the worse. During those years, the actor only seemed to be cast in box office flops, including not-so-great movies like Monkeybone, Dudley Do-Right, and <a href=# rel=nofollow>Looney Tunes: Back in Action</a>.</p><p>Finally, by 2013, Fraser starred in Gimme Shelter and, after that, seemed to be no longer cast in any new roles.</p><p>Turns out that Brendan Fraser’s career went downhill for various reasons. Firstly, the actor was sexually assaulted by the then-president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, Phillip Berk.</p><p>And when he tried to talk about the abuse he endured, this Hollywood mogul used his influence to blacklist him. In addition to this, Fraser had to deal with <a href=# rel=nofollow>numerous health issues</a>, because many of his past roles had taken a massive toll on his body.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>How Much Of Brendan Fraser's Net Worth Loses Has He Made Back In 2021?</a></span></p><p>Fortunately for Fraser and his fans, the actor has slowly made a comeback to Hollywood. In 2018, the actor managed to book a number of TV roles, he voiced Robotman on the animated series Titans, a role he reprised on HBO's Doom Patrol live-action series. And, most recently, he starred in The Whale.</p><h2 id=despite-not-having-being-released-the-whale-has-received-positive-ratings>Despite Not Having Being Released, The Whale Has Received Positive Ratings</h2><p>The Whale (2022) is a psychological drama film directed by Darren Aronofsky.

To play the lead character in The Whale, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Fraser wore a prosthetic suit</a> that added 50 to 300 pounds depending on the scene he was playing. In addition to this, the actor would spend up to six hours in the makeup chair every day in order to fully transform into the character.</p><p>Although there has been some criticism for casting Brendan Fraser for this role, as well as for having the actor wear prosthetics to give life to this character, the director of the movie, Darren Aronofsky, has repeatedly defended this choice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“There's no way you can cast someone to play this job, so we had to use makeup to get there. Most of the people that are playing critique have not seen the film. So I welcome everyone to see the film because the film is about bringing empathy to characters that you don't expect to feel for,” Aronofsky admitted (via <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Cinema Blend</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdma6zvsSnZJqqn6O8p7%2FKsmSmmZSaeqO%2BxKebmqZdm7%2Biv8SrZLCdkad6onnPq6asrJiawaqvjKysoqxdnrtuwMeeZLCZnJp8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./olivia-plath-teases-welcome-to-plathville-future-after-ethan-split.html><span>←</span><span>Olivia Plath Teases Welcome to Plathville Future After Ethan Split</span></a>
