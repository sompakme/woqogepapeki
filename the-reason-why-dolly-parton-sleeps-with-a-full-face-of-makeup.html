The star revealed that when it comes to her makeup, she prefers to sleep with a full face on, and here's why!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Who Are Dolly Parton's 11 Siblings, And What Do They Do?</a></span></p><h2 id=dolly-parton-s-makeup-secret>Dolly Parton's Makeup Secret</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dolly Parton has certainly gone on to make a name for herself in the music industry! From her stellar songwriting, all the way to her hits such as 'Jolene', and '9 to 5', Dolly has transformed the business as we know it.</p><p>While she has amassed quite the fortune, it appears as if Dolly doesn't spend too much when it comes to her iconic makeup look. The singer has always sported her big blonde curls and full-face makeup, but you know <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she isn't spending much on it.</a></p><p>Dolly revealed that when it comes to her choice of makeup, she doesn't mind drugstore! "I use a lot of Maybelline products and I've used Max Factor's Panstik makeup for all of my grown years," she said.</p><p>Considering she's been serving looks her whole career, it's only fitting that Parton also keeps herself done up at night, revealing that she does, in fact, sleep with a full face of makeup on.</p><p>When it comes to her beauty regimen in the after-hours, Dolly prefers to have an entire makeup look down in case of an emergency, and since she enjoys being presentable, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she opts for a full-face at night.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I never know if there’s going to be an earthquake or a tornado or a storm and I’m going to have to go out in the middle of the night!” Dolly said, and we don't blame her!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's Why Dolly Parton And Her Husband Of Over 50 Years Are Rarely Seen Together</a></span></p><p>While Dolly can oftentimes pull our leg, she is serious when it comes to her beauty routine at night! Parton says she does her entire regimen in the morning, from cleansing to the rest of the "beauty work" as she calls it.</p><p>When night falls, Dolly keeps her look in pristine condition, however, the possibility of a &nbsp;natural disaster isn't her only reason for sleeping with a full-face on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 'There Was Jesus' singer also likes to keep herself fixed up for her husband, Carl Thomas Dean, whom she's been married to since 1966!</p><p>“I don’t like to go home and just tear down completely, because my poor husband has to look at me,” Dolly hilariously said. Rather, the country superstate waits until “around 3 in the morning” to wash her face and “start all over again," a process that seems tirings but certainly works for Dolly!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Dolly Parton Once Turned Down This Iconic Singer</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dp7Kiv86nZLCgqWKxsLjLsmSpmaKpvK950qWcnqijYsSqwMdmmGaepaG5brLAnJxmp5ZiuqK3xK6naA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./liza-soberano-bio-facts-wiki-net-worth-age-height-enrique-gil-alone-together-tate-paren.html><span>←</span><span>Liza Soberano Bio, Facts, Wiki, Net Worth, Age, Height, Enrique Gil, Alone Together, Tate, Paren</span></a>
