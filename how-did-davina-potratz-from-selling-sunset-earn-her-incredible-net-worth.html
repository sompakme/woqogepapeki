Fans have come to know the villainous recurring cast member (<a href=#>whether Potratz is mean behind the scenes</a> is a different story entirely) of Selling Sunset quite well, as the loathed reality star has made her mark on the hit reality show. Through various endeavors, Potratz has amassed a net worth of<strong> $2 million </strong>(though her net worth isn't as impressive as show creator<strong> Adam DiVello’s</strong>). But how did the Selling Sunset star amass her fortune?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>‘Selling Sunset’: Amanza Smith Says How She Met Taye Diggs After Her Divorce</a></span></p><p><strong>Davina </strong>has managed to acquire a hefty bit of wealth for herself over the years. A shrewd business sense and a little notoriety have ensured that the 31-year-old Hamburg native is sitting not only on a nice chunk of change, but has also cemented her villainous persona in the minds of Selling Sunset’s loyal and devoted fan base. Let’s take a gander at Potratz road to riches, shall we?</p><h2 id=davina-potratz-started-out-as-a-model><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Davina Potratz Started Out As A Model</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Long before Selling Sunset and before she became a solid presence on social media, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Davina</strong> was a model</a>. After obtaining her Bachelor's Degree in advertisement, <strong>Potratz</strong> moved on to sign a modelling contract with the <strong>Ford Modelling agency</strong> back in 1999. It seems the future real estate agent was drawn to the spotlight from the very beginning.</p><h2 id=davina-potratz-made-a-few-stops-before-making-her-real-estate-debut><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Davina Potratz Made A Few Stops Before Making Her Real Estate Debut</span></h2><p><strong>Davina</strong> began to branch out from the modelling world, becoming an editorial assistant at Flaunt Magazine for a year before leaving in April 2000. Potratz then moved on to Angeleno Magazine, becoming a contributing editor. From there, Davina transitioned into the world of Sales Agent, working for a plethora of firms including Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, The Ryness Company, AEG, The Mark Company, HEI Hotels & Resorts among others. Just a taste of things to come in terms of the world of sales.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Selling Sunset': Why Did Brett Leave The Oppenheim Group?</a></span></p><h2 id=davina-potratz-then-moved-on-to-both-the-big-and-little-screen><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Davina Potratz Then Moved On To Both The Big And Little Screen</span></h2><p>Transitioning from modelling to the silver screen isn't an absolute certainty. After all, acting and modelling require a different skill set. However, both professions are suited for anyone who dreams of basking in the public eye.<strong> Davina</strong> successfully made the transition from the world of modelling to Hollywood. According to<strong> IMDb</strong>, <strong>Potratz</strong> has been featured in such films as the Jennifer Lopez vehicle Monster-in-Law, an uncredited role as herself in the TV documentary On The Set: Raising Hell and of course making a strong TV presence on Selling Sunset, debuting on the series’ third season. Undoubtedly,<strong> Potratz </strong>stint on the movie set has done much to add to her bank account.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=davina-potratz-worked-for-the-oppenheim-group-for-quite-a-while><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Davina Potratz Worked For The Oppenheim Group For Quite A While</span></h2><p>Finally, making her real estate debut, becoming an agent with Lowe Enterprises and Etco Homes.<strong> Potratz</strong> then became the Principal, New Development Sales and Marketing agent with <strong>The Davina Group</strong> until eventually finding her home at<strong> The Oppenheim Group</strong>. In 2018, Potratz became Director of New Development/Broker Associate. After making her debut on Selling Sunset, fans became very familiar with the villainous member of the illustrious Oppenheim Group, agent. Of course, change seems to be at the heart of what drives Davina, so it comes as no surprise to fans of the show when she made her exit from the very organization that made her famous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> <strong>Is 'Selling Sunset’s' Chrishell Stause Still Single?</strong></a></span></p><h2 id=davina-potratz-then-moved-on-to-douglas-elliman><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Davina Potratz Then Moved On To Douglas Elliman</span></h2><p>Having to deal with the rigors of a reality show (such as <a href=#>rules that the cast of the show must follow</a>) were not enough to stop Davina from having a change of heart and moving on from The Oppenheim Group to<strong> Douglas Elliman</strong>. According to People Magazine,<strong> Potratz</strong> said this about joining Douglas Elliman, "I'm really excited to be a part of Douglas Elliman and their very sophisticated and global new development division. My background is in new development sales and marketing, so this is just a wonderful opportunity for me. It's just very in tune with my skills." Despite her exit from The Oppenheim Group, there is no hard feelings from founder, <strong>Jason Oppenheim</strong>. According to People magazine, Jason had this to say, "Davina has always been a tremendous asset and a valued agent at the Oppenheim Group, and she is also a friend whose career decisions I very much respect and support. I will always want the best for Davina, and I hope that we continue to work together in the future."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-of-course-there-rsquo-s-davina-potratz-39-s-pending-75-million-house-sale><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>And Of Course, There’s Davina Potratz's Pending $75 Million House Sale</span></h2><p><strong>Potratz</strong> is a salesperson first and foremost and adding a pricey Hollywood mansion to your portfolio is certainly a salesperson’s crowning achievement. As of this writing, Davina has yet to sell the <strong>$75 million</strong> Hollywood mansion <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">and has even received backlash from Netflix about it (to which she sarcastically responded)</a>. However, when the property is sold, that will undoubtedly be a rather large commission and thus add to her already hefty net worth. Good luck, Ms. Potratz.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Here’s What 'Selling Sunset' Season 4 Could Look Like</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmq6Zo65uvM6tqZqsqmLAprjLoqWgZaOqu7Sx02alnqyWoba5ec2eq2avn6fBqXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./enrique-pena-nieto-net-worth-how-much-is-enrique-pena-nieto-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Enrique Pena Nieto Net Worth How Much is Enrique Pena Nieto Worth?</span></a>
