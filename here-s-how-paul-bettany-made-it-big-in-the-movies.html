Paul Bettany has a net worth of $50 million, shared with his <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">actress wife, Jennifer Connelly </a>and has made a name for himself as his career continues to move in unprecedented ways.</p><p>The 50-year-old A Beautiful Mind star not only excels on the big screen, he’s also an avid guitarist, producer, director and screenwriter. Though the A-list star has appeared in more than 40 films, he’s <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">never received an Oscar</a>, however, Bettany has been nominated for just about everything else.</p><p>Here’s how Bettany has managed to stay under the radar yet appearing in some of cinema’s biggest blockbusters to date.</p><h2 id=the-early-years>The Early Years</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bettany grew up with parents deeply ingrained in the theatre world. As the middle child in the family, Bettany’s world turned upside down when at 16-years-old, his 8-year-old brother Matthew, died from a tragic fall from a rooftop. He earned enough money to attend drama school, however, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">drug addiction took hold</a> of Bettany’s life and he was struggling.</p><h2 id=high-profile-mentors-and-admiration>High Profile Mentors and Admiration</h2><p>The Da Vinci Code actor has named heroes and those in Hollywood he admires according to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>. Always a fan of legends like Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and Humphrey Bogart, Bettany has made it clear he observes others and shapes his talent based on those that have gone before him. He’s openly spoken about <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Harrison Ford</a>’s willingness to do his own stunts, Will Smith’s charming and friendly personality and others. As an Englishman, Bettany has said he simply finds some of these personality traits difficult to portray, lending to the introverted, quiet persona we see today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">15 Marvel Actors Who Spent More Time In The Makeup Chair Than On Screen</a></span></p><h2 id=the-making-of-a-blockbuster-star>The Making of a Blockbuster Star</h2><p>Like many others, Bettany <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">got his start on the theater stage</a>, working for production house, Shakespeare’s Company in plays such as Richard III, Romeo and Juliet and Julius Caesar.

The popular miniseries was also based on Marvel Comics and Bettany reprises his role as Vision in the successful spinoff.</p><h2 id=marriage-to-jennifer-connelly>Marriage to Jennifer Connelly</h2><p>Bettany’s marriage to actress Jennifer Connelly is what he <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">credits with saving his life</a>.

After a short dating period, Bettany was moved to contact her after the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, and literally proposed to Connelly over the phone, according to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">The List</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">The pair quickly married</a> and had two children, in addition to Connelly’s son from another relationship. Bettany credits his family life for his sober living, ranking his life as husband and father as number one.</p><h2 id=scandal-with-friends>Scandal With Friends</h2><p>In 2020, the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">divorce of friend Johnny Depp and Amber Heard</a> led to a court battle as well as outing Bettany and his previous drug use. According to Depp, the two friends exchanged negative texts regarding Heard and he had also supplied Bettany with drugs in the past.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=up-next-for-bettany>Up Next for Bettany</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Yahoo!</a>, Bettany has most recently appeared in the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Amazon Prime</a> original series, A Very British Scandal, the story of The Duke and Duchess of Argyll and their 1960 notorious divorce.
