They started their modeling careers in the early 2000s, and since then, they <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">have walked the runways for the majority of the world's top fashion</a> brands. It would be an understatement to say they are busy during fashion week. They are renowned for having distinctive beauty and fashion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Due to her high-profile relationships</a> and probably because she is a little more extroverted than her sister, Gigi is frequently in the media more than her sister. She has a fun attitude and loves to interact with others. Yet that doesn't make Bella any less beautiful. Bella has a more mysterious and edgy look, which tends to match her personality. Her unique features and striking runway presence have earned her, her notoriety in the industry.</p><p>Both of them have appeared on the Met Gala best-dressed list; in fact, <a href=#>Gigi has won the best dressed award more than once</a>. Also, both of them have done numerous print advertisements for luxury brands and appeared in numerous international editions of fashion magazines including Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. During the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">British Fashion Awards, Bella most recently took home the title of model of the year</a>, which her sister has already earned.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# title="Zayn Malik & Gigi Hadid Still Care About Each Other Despite Messy Split ">Zayn Malik & Gigi Hadid Still Care About Each Other Despite Messy Split</a></span></p><p>To reach their current position in the industry, they have put in a lot of effort. Although the word "Supermodel" is no longer utilized in the fashion industry, it has been frequently used by their admirers. While the title "supermodel" isn't insulting, the industry has only ever recognized and hailed six women as supermodels. It is an honor to be regarded as one of those women because they broke down many barriers for models today.</p><p>In almost any outfit, Gigi and Bella Hadid may step out into public and establish a new trend. Much of Gigi's recent wardrobe choices have been evocative of the 1990s and Y2K eras. The ankle bracelet is one of those styles. Ankle bracelets were once worn by all women and even some men. Also extremely popular were toe rings. We are very thrilled they are back. They make the legs so attractive and offer such a lovely touch of femininity. Jewelry is a very small thing, that has the power to make big changes in how we feel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anklets typically run 9 to 10 inches long but can be adjusted. Although there are many various designs, the gold ankle bracelet is by far the most popular. Why? Gold contrasts well with tanned skin. Women tend to wear ankle bracelets more frequently in the summer when their legs are darker and the gold contrasts beautifully with that. Of course, you are free to dress however you want. We have compiled a list of the greatest celebrity-inspired anklets so you can up your style game for spring and summer.</p><h2 id=gold-anklet-with-cubic-zirconia-and-initial><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Gold Anklet with Cubic Zirconia And Initial</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/iefshiny.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><strong>Gold Initial Anklet</strong></a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A cubic zirconia chain and an initial anklet make up the stacked initial anklet.
