The bikini is still available for purchase on the Praying website and costs $140.</p><p>NBC News reported that someone spoke on behalf of Adidas and said "Our partnership with Praying is specific to the limited release of a Supernova Cushion 7 shoe."</p><p>While Addison Rae didn't say anything about the Adidas scandal, she did answer a question in an interview with E! News about how she handles people who say mean things online. Since she has been in the public eye for a long time now, it makes sense that she would have some perspective on the subject.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/addison-rae-1.jpg><p>Rae said, "It's something that takes lots of work, and just reminding yourself that you are the way you are for a reason. It's definitely not easy at all times because there is negativity and there are hate comments and people that are just looking to bring you down. But at the end of the day, it's just really about positivity and being happy and loving who you are and embracing that. Your flaws make you who you are and that's what makes you unique."</p><p>Overall, Addison Rae seems to focus on the good in her life, even though people often leave harsh comments on her Instagram account or talk about her online. In an interview with Highsnobiery.com, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rae discussed her career</a> and said:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"One thing about me that surprises people is that I am just as happy as I am in the pictures. I try to always be positive, and people think that's not real. No matter what situation I've been in my entire life, good or bad, I've always [known] that things pass and get better.”</p><p>Addison Rae has had another big scandal over the years. In 2021, Buzzfeed reported that she joked about working as a journalist. She tweeted "I studied broadcast journalism in college for 3 whole months to prepare for this moment" and posted photos standing with the UFC logo behind her. People were upset and said that a lot of journalism students have difficulty being hired in the industry, which is unfair since they have gone to school and hustled for so many years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdlrGltdKopWaqkZrAbq3Dopuaq12osKK6w5qjZqClp8FutMSrZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./charli-baltimore-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Charli Baltimore Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
