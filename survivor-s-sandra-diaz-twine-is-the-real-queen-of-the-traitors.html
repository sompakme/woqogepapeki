(Parvati, 41, was recruited early on by the traitors and ultimately banished in the February 15 episode.)</p><p>As one of the remaining faithfuls, Sandra proved she was an asset to the team when she proposed a plan to keep her crew safe while taking out <strong>Peter Weber</strong>‚Äôs alliance of the ‚Äúmost faithful of the faithfuls.‚Äù In an instantly memed teaching moment with billiards balls, Sandra gathered the outcasts from the <a href=#>Peter Pals alliance</a> and demonstrated how they could all make it to the end. Following the episode, Sandra shared some insight on the impromptu strategy session.</p><p>‚ÄúI want to make something clear. During that strategy session üé± I also made it clear that hopefully, the traitors were in our group so that they could murder each, and everyone of the so-called most faithful of the faithful, therefore allowing the faithful in the leftovers to get to the end of the game,‚Äù she wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> earlier this month. ‚ÄúSelf-preservation and end game strategy. What a lot of people don‚Äôt seem to understand is faithful also have to go just like the Traitors. We all can‚Äôt get to the end.‚Äù</p><p>She explained that her group, which consists of <strong>CT Tamburello</strong>, <strong>Shere√© Whitfield</strong>, <strong>Kate Chastain</strong> and <strong>Mercedes ‚ÄúMJ‚Äù Javid</strong>, were all aware that Parvati and <strong>Phaedra Parks</strong> had been called out on multiple occasions for being traitors.</p><p>Sandra believed that her group needed to keep the people they were sure were traitors in the mix so the faithfuls could have a fighting chance to take home the cash prize. If one traitor gets banished, the remaining traitor(s) can recruit a new member to the team, which means the faithfuls have to ‚Äústart back from zero.‚Äù</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Peter, 32, tried to implement this exact strategy in his own game after it was too late. After being against Parvati since day one, he tried to pull her to his side, which inspired suspicion among the other competitors. Peter‚Äôs fate is now up in the air as the recent episode ended on a cliffhanger, with the vote being tied between Peter and Phaedra. MJ‚Äôs still-unrevealed vote will be the deciding factor in the February 29 episode.</p><p>If Peter gets banished, Sandra will find herself in a powerful position as one of the major swing votes at the round table. And from there, it‚Äôs just a short walk to the finish line.</p><p>The Traitors airs on Peacock Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKquqqaew7C%2B0maqmqaUp65usMiasWasp567pnnIrGStoJViv6aty2aorp2Vo3qwsoytn55lpKeuqsDOq6po</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shop-the-20-best-cyber-week-outerwear-deals.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Shop the 20 Best Cyber Week Outerwear Deals</span></a>
