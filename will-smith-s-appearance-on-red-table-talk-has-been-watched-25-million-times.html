Too big for Facebook to sit back and ignore. That's why it launched Facebook Watch a while back. Not a television channel per se, but an extension of its social media platform on which it airs original programming. One of the most popular shows on Facebook Watch is Red Table Talk.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Red Table Talk is hosted by <a href=#>Jada Pinket Smith</a> who is often joined by her daughter Willow and sometimes her mother,&nbsp;Adrienne Banfield-Norris. Jada brings on celebrity guests and talks about controversial and often uncomfortable topics including affairs and parenting troubles. Of the more than 60 episodes to date, the one that aired this past weekend might have been the most uncomfortable so far.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Will Smith's Wife Reveals Heated Argument She Had With His Ex</a></span></p><p>The episode was teased at the start of the month when Jada revealed that she would be bringing herself to the table. However, that's the only hint viewers were given as to what the episode would pertain to until it dropped on Facebook Watch this past Friday night. Jada had her husband <a href=#>Will Smith</a> on the show, and the pair discussed Jada's admission to having a relationship with August Alsina while she and Will were separated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The language Jada used to describe her relationship with August was fascinating, describing it as an entanglement. While Jada appears to view it as ancient history and doesn't seem nearly as bothered by whatever it was Will did to get back at her which is mentioned briefly, the whole ordeal clearly knocked will for six. He looked like he was fighting back tears for the majority of the episode.</p><p>As for how many people have watched the episode, within 24 hours of it going live, 15.4 million people had&nbsp;seen it. That's according to the counter on Facebook which registers anyone who has watched a video for three seconds or more. That number had grown to 25.5 million by the time of writing this less than three days later. As for whether it is the most-watched episode of Red Table Talk to date, that won't be clear until Facebook has tabulated how many people have watched at least one minute of the episode.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Suicide Squad Director Wants His Own Snyder Cut</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5np565rXnSpqCtoF2frqWtjKmgp6OVqcFuvsSdZK2ZkqGybsDApaJmamViuqq4y6Kmp2WmnrK4v44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nine-eight-wedding-guest-dress-has-shoppers-saying-yes-to-it.html><span>←</span><span>Nine.Eight Wedding Guest Dress Has Shoppers Saying Yes to It</span></a>
