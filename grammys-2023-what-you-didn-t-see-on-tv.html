When <a href=#><strong>Beyoncé</strong></a> took home her 32nd Grammy, <a href=#>winning Best Dance/Electronic Album</a> for Renaissance, Lizzo snapped a pic with <a href=#><strong>Adele</strong></a> in the audience to <a href=#>remember the historic moment</a>.</p><p>Lizzo and the “Easy On Me” performer, 34, were <a href=#>seated next to each other</a> during the ceremony — and couldn’t have been more excited. An insider exclusively tells Us Weekly that the pop stars were caught <a href=#>laughing and holding onto one another</a> as they caught up before host <a href=#><strong>Trevor Noah</strong></a> officially kicked off the awards.</p><p>Both the “Juice” artist and Adele were victorious on Sunday night, winning Record of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance, respectively. Lizzo was quick to <a href=#>celebrate her peers’ achievements</a> as they collected their Grammys — and <a href=#>she wasn’t the only one</a>.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a> gave a <a href=#>standing ovation</a> to music legend <a href=#><strong>Willie Nelson</strong></a>, who won Best Country Solo Performance and Best Country Album on Sunday night. While he wasn’t present to accept his trophies, the 33-year-old “All Too Well” artist was <a href=#>one of the first audience members to get on her feet</a> when Nelson’s name was announced.</p><p>The Cats actress also applauded Styles, 29, <a href=#>when he won his first award of the night</a>: Best Pop Vocal Album for Harry’s House. The “Satellite” crooner and Swift briefly dated in late 2012, and the exes have <a href=#>proven multiple times</a> over the years that there’s no bad blood between them.</p><p>In a video exclusively obtained by Us on Sunday, Styles and the “Clean” songstress were spotted chatting and laughing together as <a href=#><strong>Steve Lacy</strong></a> performed his hit “Bad Habit.” According to the onlooker, <a href=#>the former couple appeared “civil”</a> but didn’t hug.</p><p>Styles went on to <a href=#>win Album of the Year</a> after shocking snubs for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. He defeated an impressive group of musicians, including Beyoncé, <a href=#><strong>Bad Bunny</strong></a> and <a href=#>Coldplay</a>.</p><p>“Man, I’ve been so, so inspired by every artist in this category with me. At a lot of different times in my life, I’ve listened to everyone in this category,” the <a href=#>Don’t Worry Darling</a> actor gushed in his acceptance speech. “And I think on nights like tonight it’s so important for us to remember that there is no such thing as best in music. I don’t think any of us sit in the studio making decisions based on what is going to get us one of these.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The X Factor UK alum continued: “This is really, really kind. I’m so, so grateful. This doesn’t happen to people like me very often. This is so, so nice. Thank you very, very much.”</p><p>Scroll down for a closer look inside of the 2023 Grammy Awards:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bcv6K5zLKqZmpgZ4Buw8eaq2axn6p6pbXDp6tmq5WaerC6jK2taA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./duchess-sophie-breaks-silence-after-police-escort-killed-elderly-woman.html><span>←</span><span>Duchess Sophie Breaks Silence After Police Escort Killed Elderly Woman</span></a>
