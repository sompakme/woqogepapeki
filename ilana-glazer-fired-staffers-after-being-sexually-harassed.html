I’ve fired a couple dudes — one background actor and a sound guy.”</p><p>Glazer admitted that people questioned her decision to fire the two guys, but knew she had to, especially given that she had the power to act on it as a showrunner. The actress said, “I was asked, ‘Are you sure?’ Hm, okay yeah lemme think a sec — yeah I’m f–king SURE. Cuz getting sexually harassed seems to be a constant, but having the opportunity to do something about it is rare.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The <i>Rough Night </i>star thanked <b>Trace Lysette</b> and <a href=#><b>Viola Davis</b></a> for giving her the courage to share her stories, captioning the post: “#metoo – big queenly thanks to @tracelysette & @violadavis posting this so I felt brave enough to!”</p><p>Glazer is one of <a href=#>many actresses</a> and <a href=#>other social media users</a> who bravely shared their own past experiences with sexual assault and harassment using the hashtag #MeToo.<a href=#><b> Alyssa Milano</b></a> began the trend on Twitter after dozens of women came forward last week with <a href=#>accusations of sexual misconduct</a> against film producer <a href=#><b>Harvey Weinstein</b></a> — and since then the hashtag has been used thousands of times by both women and men sharing their stories.</p><p>For the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, <a href=#>subscribe to</a> Us Weekly’s YouTube Page.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaipJGjrm6zy5qxnqpdm7azscNmqq2Zlpuys7%2BMmp2tnaJir6a1zaBkrJ2oqq6tuNhmn5qqkajAprCMsGxpcWVrg3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./flavor-flav-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Flavor Flav Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
