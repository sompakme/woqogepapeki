The High School Musical&nbsp;singer and actress has also starred alongside some of Hollywood's finest actors, such as Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, Josh Hutcherson, Will Smith, Martin Lawrence, and<a href=#> Zac Efron</a>. She has also produced a total of three music albums featuring genres in Dance-pop, Contemporary R&B, Teen pop, Electropop, and Rhythm and blues. Her success has afforded her many luxuries, one of those being the $5 million home she purchased from Academy Award-Winning actor Gary Oldman. See how she basks in the serenity of her home and what she's done to give it a tinge of her own flavor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-rich-history>A Rich History</h2><p>Most celebrities value mansions that are decked with the latest architectural designs, enhanced technological fittings, and superior interior ornaments. But not Ms. Hudgens. She appreciates and even favors things that are vintage, like the 3,168 square foot home she spent five years house-hunting. The colonial home was actually built by <a href=#>legendary filmmaker</a> Cecil B. DeMille who constructed the house for his mistress in 1922, eventually nicknaming the estate 'Little DeMille'. Sounding like a true hopeless romantic, Hudgens said in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Design</a>, "To me, there's something so romantic about that, a home with character and quirks." And true to her love of authentic vintage artifacts, she also expressed her love for The Art Deco air vents, over-head chandeliers, mohair sofa, travertine stacking tables, a wooden chime clock, and a collection of vintage books from various parts of the world. Her walls are also decorated with large vintage posters and prints from abstract photographers. Did I mention she's really into vintage?!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In keeping with the French feel that exudes from the home's exterior with its embellishment of olive trees in the yard, as well as the 18th-century French oak floors taken from a chapel in Europe that actor<a href=#> Gary Oldman </a>had fitted in prior to Hudgens purchasing the home; one of her vintage wall posters is also of the French film Breathless. Despite being a modern woman, she admits that she was always in search of an 'old home'. She also went ahead and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hired celebrity interior-designer, Jake Arnold,</a> to compliment her vision for the living room space. Hudgens credits Arnold for helping her to create a 'casual, relaxed, and cozy' atmosphere, beautifying almost every corner of the house with candlesticks, huge bouquets, and indoor plants.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>25 Facts About Vanessa Hudgens That Fans Cannot Ignore Anymore</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ins-and-outs-of-little-demille>Ins-and-Outs Of 'Little DeMille'</h2><p>Out of all the <a href=#>top celebrity mansions</a> on display, Vanessa Hudgens appears to have one of the simplest. From the living room to the dining room and even the kitchen, antique rugs from Lawrence La Brea in Los Angeles run throughout the home. Starting in the kitchen, she reveals that a major remodel was done during the pandemic with her free time. The kitchen countertops she made of sparkling white Carrera marble fitted the floors with travertine tile for an authentic <a href=#>Italian</a> feel. The handcrafted fireclay sinks she received from Shaw and, of course, gave it a facelift with a few plants. Additionally, she got busy opening up the cabinets by replacing a few of them with rustic oak beans for shelving. She also painted the entire cabinet over in a soft femme olive green shade that greatly added to the Italian effect she was going for. And not far away is a modest breakfast table tucked neatly in a corner, equipped with a 1920s <a href=#>New Orleans</a> style sofa chair&nbsp;leaning against a unique wallpaper from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">House of Hackney</a> littered with mushrooms and mythical dragons. She got the idea from a restaurant in New York called Maison Premiere that she is very fond of.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From there, a swinging door takes you into the dining room area, which is exquisite yet simple. Hudgens seems to have a passion for interior design and an artistic eye, as she purposefully purchased a wooden dining table to match the floor patterns, which blend quite well together. The 1950s chandelier hovering overhead the table was meant to inspire a romantic Italian setting, with a double-door that opens to the backyard where all the olive trees are in plain view. It's like a slice of Italy in <a href=#>Hollywood.</a></p><p>Onto her bedroom, for her, it represents the epitome of femininity. Plastered with nude paintings of feminine figures throughout her walls, she made sure to have the decor make a statement. Making the color theme of velvet orange, she made sure that the curtains embodied her taste. Her bedroom is filled with antiques and vintage pieces, such as a pair of sconces from Obsolete&nbsp;and two marble bedside tables that she had originally crafted. Connected to her bedroom haven is the bathroom, where Hudgens treasures as one of her favorite places. The cave-like presence is where she wanted to feel 'sexy' with black-painted walls, marble sink countertops, and an egg-shaped bathtub is the <a href=#>Disney star's</a>&nbsp;'favorite' place in the house.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The next enchanting part of Hudgen's mansion would be her <a href=#>outside pool</a>. One can also appreciate the Ivy vines covering the brick areas of the front of the house, which Vanessa is proud to say is a rarity in Los Angeles. Going back to the pool area, a silver vintage drama mask chair is stationed on the deck of the pool, which compliments the single-line portraits that she had painted on the pool wall. There are also wooden lounge chairs for sunbathing and a seating area under an olive tree. Her artsy, earthy, gothic style definitely has set her home apart in style, and she is unapologetic about it.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>Vanessa Hudgen's Success After Being A Disney Star</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Digest,</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FancyPantsHomes</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaipqOesaZ5y6KrraSVYrGmucilo55lppa7pr%2FSmmShrZScsq%2B%2FjK2pmqajpbyzwMinnmakn6h6p7HLorFmoJ%2BisnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./doutzen-kroes-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Doutzen Kroes Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
