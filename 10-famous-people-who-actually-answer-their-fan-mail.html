So Far</a></span>Unfortunately, not a lot of famous people reply. This has nothing to do with them not appreciating the fans' love and support, but it's important to understand that they are not only very busy but also receive a huge amount of comments, calls, and letters every day. It's impossible to keep everyone happy. However, some celebs love taking their time to answer to as many people as they can, and fans are very grateful for that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=david-walliams><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>David Walliams</span></h2><p>David Walliams doesn't only read and reply to his fan mail for the sake of his fans, he actually looks forward to it. The comedian and <a href=#>Britain's Got Talent</a> judge obviously can't answer each and every letter he ever gets. Inevitably, some will slip through. But he loves engaging with his fans and answers as many letters and messages in general as he can. In fact, when due to a problem at the post office a bunch of fan mail was lost, he asked people to write to him again.</p><p>"The Metropolitan Police Service just told me my post was stolen, including a large box of letters from children that had been sent via @HarperCollins," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David posted on Twitter</a>. "So I apologise if you sent a letter & have not received a reply as I do endeavour to reply to everyone. If in doubt please write again."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Taylor Swift</span></h2><p>The amount of fan mail <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> receives must be insane, so fans shouldn't feel bad if they send something and don't get a reply. She does her best to go through every letter, but she can only do so much. However, she strives to reply whenever she can, and the proof of that is the many fans that have posted about the singer's kindhearted ways of engaging with them. She has sent flowers to teens that had written to her before prom, has replied to little kids who sent her drawings, and showed her support to fans that were going through a hard time through loving words. She's also pretty active on social media, often responding to fans' posts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jonathan-banks><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Jonathan Banks</span></h2><p>The Breaking Bad star is always happy to talk to the viewers of the show. Jonathan Banks has a special fan mail address, and while he might take some time to reply because of how many letters he receives, he will try and respond to every fan that shows their love.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Aaron Paul's Biggest Roles (Besides 'Breaking Bad')</a></span></p><p>Many people who have sent either letters or things for him to sign have received replies and autographs, so if someone reading this is a Breaking Bad fan, just know the chance to get an autograph from Jonathan is right there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=john-legend><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>John Legend</span></h2><p><a href=#>John Legend</a> loves having a relationship with his fans, but fan mail is not necessarily his favorite way to do it. It makes sense, considering his fans are probably mostly millennials and younger people, so in his case, fan mail got replaced with social media interactions. People have asked him questions or made comments to him about music or something else on Twitter, and on many occasions, they have gotten responses.</p><h2 id=flea><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Flea</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's relatively easy to get a reply from the <a href=#>Red Hot Chili Peppers</a> bass player. When scrolling through his Twitter profile, a lot of his posts are just replies to questions from fans. He likes to have fun with his responses, so many of them are either jokes or witty comments, but his fans love interacting with him. To connect with him the old-fashioned way, people can send mail to the Silverlake Conservatory of Music, the music school that he founded. Replies usually take a few months, though.</p><h2 id=krist-novoselic><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Krist Novoselic</span></h2><p>Krist Novoselic, the bass player from the iconic 90s grunge band, Nirvana, is not that into social media. So, to get in touch with him, people need to send actual letters.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything We Know About The Nirvana Baby And His Current Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The whole process might take longer than sending a tweet, but it's worth it. Krist takes the time to read and reply to as many letters as he can, and he has no problem signing things for people.</p><h2 id=tim-allen><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Tim Allen</span></h2><p><a href=#>Tim Allen</a> is famous for his role as Tim "The Toolman" Taylor on Home Improvement. He also voiced Buzz Lightyear for the Toy Story franchise and has worked in countless other amazing projects. Despite being such an important, famous actor, he's not too busy for the people that like his work. He has sent many autographs to fans over the years and has read and answered lots of letters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=leah-remini><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Leah Remini</span></h2><p><a href=#>Leah Remini</a> doesn't only read and reply to fan mail, she actually encourages fans to send her stuff by giving them a set of rules so that they can get in touch with her. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">On her website</a>, there is a section that the King of Queens star dedicated to instructing her fans on how to send their mail. The process is pretty simple, but since it goes through the fan club before, it's important to do everything correctly, because if the letter doesn't meet the standards, it won't reach Leah. If it does, though, it's almost guaranteed a reply.</p><h2 id=chelsea-peretti><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Chelsea Peretti</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chelsea Peretti has taken her interactions with fans to the next level. While she replies to fan mail occasionally, the comedian and <a href=#>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</a> star prefers social media. She regularly responds to questions from fans on Twitter, and for some time she hosted Call Chelsea Peretti, in which she received calls from fans who would ask questions about their lives or about the world or about anything, really. Chelsea would reply to the best of her abilities, not always giving the best advice, but making the fans happy.</p><h2 id=miley-cyrus><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Miley Cyrus</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Miley Cyrus is one of the biggest artists in the world right now, but that doesn't stop her from replying to her adoring fans. The young singer still replies to traditional fan mail and has been known for sending back autographs when requested, but lately, fans have been surprised to see how active Miley was on TikTok. Last year, she was seen commenting on her followers' videos. Not all of them, of course, but she had some fun with it, and the fans surely appreciated it, especially considering how tough last year was.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>What Has Jamie Lynn Spears Been Up To In 2021?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhoaWWWlrqwwdJmp56noKGybsPHqGSam6Sqrq242GaYp6unmr9ussCnZKaZmaF6ta3YpaarZaOstqfAjKOmoaZdobKosc2dZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-casting-decisions-that-saved-the-walking-dead-10-that-hurt-it.html><span>←</span><span>10 Casting Decisions That Saved The Walking Dead (10 That Hurt It)</span></a>
