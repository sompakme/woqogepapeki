Costner — who was standing on a palm-tree covered cliff overlooking the ocean — noted that he and his wife, <a href=#><strong>Christine Baumgartner</strong></a>, were stuck in Santa Barbara due to the severe California floods.</p><p>“Nobody’s sadder than us that we can’t be there at the Golden Globes,” the Bodyguard actor shared, adding that he and Baumgartner, 48, even had to “pull the kids out of school” due to the devastation. (The couple share three kids; <a href=#>Costner is also dad to four adult children</a> from two previous relationships.)</p><p>After announcing <a href=#>Costner’s win for best actor in a drama series</a> at the Beverly Hilton, Hall, 52, began reading off the teleprompter — and laughing and rolling her eyes at what was written.</p><p>“Kevin Costner, he so much wanted to be — ,” she started before cracking up. She then addressed the audience, saying, “I always like how they write this. It’s like, ‘He so much wanted to be — ’ no, I’m sure he did,” she cracked.</p><p>“But because of the — it’s been raining — the unprecedented weather and flooding, he has to shelter in place in Santa Barbara,” the Girls Trip star continued, smacking her forehead and muttering, “Jesus,” as the audience roared.</p><p>“No, this is a sad story right now. He’s stuck in Santa Barbara. Let’s pray everyone,” Hall said, attempting to keep her composure. “Everyone, we do, we pray and we hope everyone affected by these storms remains safe. I’m gonna set that award right there, on your behalf, Kevin.”</p><p>For their part, Costner revealed in the Instagram video that he and Baumgartner were going to be celebrating at home. “She went out and bought me some gold and yellow and black and silver balloons, and so we’re gonna [watch] the television and see what happens,” the Oscar winner said in the somber address, apologizing for his absence.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’m really sorry to the Golden Globes and the international press,” he stated. “I hope we’re invited back. Thanks.”</p><p>Costner’s 2023 Golden Globe marks <a href=#>his third win and sixth nomination</a>. He previously won a best actor statuette in 2013 for the Hatfields & McCoys as well as a best director award for his iconic 1990 film Dances With Wolves.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmen5mjrm60wKWjZqWfmLi0ecqeraKmXZi8tMDNnqmsZZekuaWxzWaepaeSmsBurcGsnKeblWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ray-j-and-princess-love-share-1st-photos-of-newborn-son-epik-life-is-complete.html><span>←</span><span>Ray J and Princess Love Share 1st Photos of Newborn Son Epik: Life Is Complete</span></a>
