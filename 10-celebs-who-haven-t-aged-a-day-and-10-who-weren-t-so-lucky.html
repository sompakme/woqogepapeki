Some folks can basically look like they’re in their twenties or thirties even when hitting 50. Others can look ready for Social Security before they hit 40. Folks can go grey in their 20s, others without a wrinkle even when 60. It’s funny and shows how genetics can be like the lottery. In Hollywood, a town that rests on its looks, how you age can be very important. Far too many child actors have seen their careers ruined when puberty kicked in and aged them way too much too fast. Of course, these celebs do enhancements and such to keep themselves looking young, but sometimes that actually makes them look even worse.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But there are many who are lucky in the looks department, and they use it to their advantage. It’s not just aging gracefully, it’s barely looking like any time has passed even when they’ve been around for decades. There is the sad flip side, those who, for one reason or another, have aged to the point you’d think they’re twice as old as they really are or just aged more in a short span. Here are 10 female celebrities who don’t appear to have aged a day in years and 10 who sadly seem to have gotten twice as old twice as fast to show how lucky some can be.</p><h2 id=doubled-lark-voorhies>DOUBLED: Lark Voorhies</h2><p>To this day, Saved By the Bell remains an icon of teen programming. The 1990s hit has gained a huge audience with many loving its cheesy humor and throwbacks to a time before the Internet. The stars have remained well known although a few have hit bad times. Elizabeth Berkley did Showgirls, Dustin Diamond has been in jail and more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2015, Jimmy Fallon did a big bit reuniting almost the whole cast to replay their character. Notable by her absence was Lark Voorhies. Her Lisa was quite popular, the fashion-conscious gal who put up with the near stalking of geeky Screech. However, one look at Voorhies today and it’s obvious why Fallon didn’t have her on. To be fair, she’s had health issues, but there was also an issue of substance usage. It’s taken its toll as the once gorgeous woman looks quite bad today. She’s actually looking better than a few years ago where her appearance was truly shocking but still jarring.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hasn-t-aged-julia-roberts>HASN’T AGED: Julia Roberts</h2><p>There may be a couple wrinkles here and there but for the most part, Julia Roberts still looks as astounding as when she broke out in movies 30 years ago. It’s forgotten how she was already on the rise with an Oscar nomination for Steel Magnolias. Then Pretty Woman turned her into the biggest female star on the planet. That grin, that lush red hair, the bright eyes, that glorious laugh, it all came together into a package moviegoers couldn’t resist. She’s had ups and downs but has survived them all. Her slumps are brief and comes back with hits like Notting Hill and then winning an Oscar for Erin Brockovich.</p><p>Her power is maintained as proven by how she can command millions for even a brief role like Mother’s Day. Roberts can glow on a red carpet and even be named “The Most Beautiful Woman” by People magazine while maintaining that amazing glow. She has her mockers but Roberts proves that dazzling smile is timeless to maintain her beauty.</p><h2 id=doubled-amanda-bynes>DOUBLED: Amanda Bynes</h2><p>If there’s a child star who looked the least likely to fly off the rails, Amanda Bynes was it. She came to fame on the Nick series All That and then got her own show. Bynes&nbsp;had a great comedic depth&nbsp;which led to further success&nbsp;like with the hit What I Like About You. Then came movie fame with What a Girl Wants, She’s the Man, Hairspray and Easy A.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It looked like she was about truly take off into the A-list and further success. And almost overnight, it all came apart. Before anyone knew it, this woman had collapsed into&nbsp;substance use, arrests, a psychiatric stay, a brief career as a fashion designer and more. Instantly, Bynes was making Lindsay Lohan look rational and her career was pretty much over. She seems to be doing better but hints she still has some issues. It’s taken its toll on Bynes’ looks, her childlike innocence long faded away. She hit 31, but she looks well into her 40s.</p><h2 id=hasn-t-aged-ming-na-wen>HASN’T AGED: Ming Na Wen</h2><p>That a woman at 53 can be one of the&nbsp;best looking action fighters on TV is amazing. Given how it’s a woman who looks just like she did in 1994, it’s even more remarkable. Mina Na got attention on the first season of ER, leaving for a brief sitcom but later returning. She also gained fame with some movies such as Street Fighter and a variety of other TV shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After a long break, Ming returned to fame in 2013 as Agent May on Agents of SHIELD. She’s since been the best part of the show, as she is an amazing actress and has crazy good fighting scenes. She goes from fighting a dozen HYDRA agents to taking down robots all by herself, she is multi talented on the show and off it. There’s a lot of great stuff on the show but seeing how Ming still looks exactly the same as nearly a quarter century ago is a true marvel.</p><h2 id=doubled-mischa-barton>DOUBLED: Mischa Barton</h2><p>Mischa Barton first got attention for her short but memorable turn as a ghost girl in The Sixth Sense. In 2003, she was launched to stardom as Marissa in the Fox show The O.C. Instantly, Barton was all over the place with magazine covers, endorsements and movie offers pouring in, and she became a mainstay at award shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, fame soon brought its demons as Barton was soon noted for things like fainting at parties, arrests, and even holding up productions because she was busy focusing on substances. The producers&nbsp;wrote off her character in the third season finale and Barton’s own life soon fell into a mess that made her a tabloid favorite. She made a comeback with The Beautiful Life only to have it axed in two episodes, ending with stories of Barton apparently brought to a hospital. Today, Barton&nbsp;looks way older than 32, her career pretty much dead. It shows how Hollywood can destroy a young starlet in very bad ways.</p><h2 id=hasn-t-aged-catherine-bell>HASN’T AGED: Catherine Bell</h2><p>There’s something about this woman that defies time in amazing ways. Catherine Bell’s first “exposure” was being the body double for Isabella Rossellini in Death Becomes Her. She had some roles in various minor movies and TV shows when she landed a part on the first season finale of JAG. She made such an impression that she was hired on the next year as Sarah “Mac” Mackenzie and&nbsp;looked great in that uniform to make the show a long-lasting hit. She also became a favorite for magazines to show her curvaceous body off in bikinis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The gorgeous brunette made a great comeback in Army Wives, another long-running smash. Today, Bell stars in the Hallmark Channels series The Good Witch and while she plays the mother of a teenager, she still looks too young for that. She’s about to hit 50 yet looks almost the same as in her JAG prime, showing Bell may have some real magic to her after all.</p><h2 id=doubled-cher>DOUBLED: Cher</h2><p>If you want a clear and obvious case of how too much work is a bad thing, Cher is it. Her great singing voice made her a star with husband Sonny Bono in the 1960s and 70s and showed a great style in various ways. In the 1980s, she became a major Hollywood star, truly gorgeous in roles like The Witches of Eastwick and winning an Oscar for Moonstruck. She’s continued on, even a full icon with a major following for her style and singing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sadly, the work she’s undergone has marred Cher’s look, freezing her face, especially in the lips. That was on full display in 2010’s Burlesque as Cher’s great voice couldn’t make up for how terrible she looked trying to sell herself as a beautiful older woman. It’s as if she aged twice as much in the 90s and not in a very good way. She was once a truly&nbsp;beautiful woman but today, Cher is more of a joke thanks to her bad looks.</p><h2 id=hasn-t-aged-reese-witherspoon>HASN’T AGED: Reese Witherspoon</h2><p>Look at Reese Witherspoon today and you’d see almost no difference than when she starred in Legally Blonde. She always had a great talent in her, showing drive in early roles like A Far Off Place. Cruel Intentions and Election showed her great talent off before&nbsp;Legally Blonde&nbsp;turned her into a box office powerhouse. Whether in comedy or drama, Witherspoon shines remarkably well with her All-American looks, Southern charm and that lush blonde hair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her Oscar win showcases more of her talent and she’s not afraid of taking chances (like baring all in the drama Wild). Her recent showcase in Big Little Lies continues her great run as Witherspoon never ceases to amaze on screen. That she keeps up that great shape with three kids is remarkable as even going sans makeup on a day out, you’d swear it’s a throwback photo to a decade and a half ago. It’s possible Witherspoon can look timeless for much longer and remain a beloved sweetheart.</p><h2 id=doubled-barbara-streisand>DOUBLED: Barbara Streisand</h2><p>Go back and look at Barbara Streisand when she started out in the late 1960s and you will see an incredibly beautiful woman. With her gorgeous singing voice, Streisand was an instant star but movies unlocked her fantastic talent with comedy and drama as well. She won the Oscar for Funny Girl and showed her fun style off in numerous hits like What’s Up Doc, The Way We Were, A Star is Born and more. She also broke out as a director with Yentl and impressing with her work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Streisand is infamous as one of the most demanding women in all of entertainment, living up to her “diva” title in every way imaginable. As time has gone on, she’s also aged poorly with some&nbsp;work for “corrections” that just end up making her look worse. She tries her best but is nowhere near the gorgeous lady she once was. That, with her bad reputation has lessened her power in Hollywood.</p><h2 id=hasn-t-aged-cindy-crawford>HASN’T AGED: Cindy Crawford</h2><p>There are a lot of supermodels but Cindy Crawford still stands high among them all. In the 1990s, she was everywhere from magazine covers to TV ads, including an epic Pepsi spot at the 1992 Super Bowl. She had a hand at movies (the flop Fair Game) but better suited to work like hosting House of Style.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some models sadly see their looks fade when they reach 40 but at 52, Crawford still looks sensational. Indeed, she’s posted pics of herself on vacation in dresses or bikinis and still rocking a body women half her age would love to have. The recent Super Bowl had her recreating&nbsp;her famous Pepsi advertisement, with fans barely seeing a difference from then and now . That dazzling smile can still impress as can her pure beauty to show that Crawford truly puts the “super” in supermodel.</p><h2 id=doubled-meg-ryan>DOUBLED: Meg Ryan</h2><p>In the 1990s, Meg Ryan was the queen of romantic comedies. Her turn in When Harry Met Sally made her a star. Ryan kept it up with Sleepless in Seattle, French Kiss, City of Angels, You’ve Got Mail and so many more. She also showed some tough edges with Courage Under Fire and became beloved by fans for her great beauty and comic drive.</p><p>But it hit a major road block in 1999 when Ryan, married to Dennis Quaid, had a relationship with Russell Crowe while filming Proof of Life. Her career never recovered as fans weren’t as eager to embrace her as a romantic lady after that. Not helping was her decision to undergo some&nbsp;work which makes her look even worse and older than 56. It’s astounding that a woman who dominated the box office in the ‘90s could be unemployed today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hasn-t-aged-sandra-bullock>HASN’T AGED: Sandra Bullock</h2><p>It’s forgotten how much of a veteran Sandra Bullock is. She was in her 20s when she started landing TV roles like a Bionic Man/Woman movie and a short-lived sitcom. She was just hitting 30 when she landed her star-making role in Speed&nbsp;which pushed her into a major Hollywood starlet. Bullock has spent the last twenty years with some amazing work in various smash hit movies and hit her height of fame by winning the Oscar for The Blind Side.</p><p>She’s still going strong with a mix of dramas but also her fantastic comedy side on full display and also a fantastic person in public. She gets sympathy for things like her bitter divorce, since Bullock’s wonderful spirit wins folks over. She and Nicole Kidman had a run-in at the Oscars that had folks instantly begging for a Practical Magic sequel. Bullock is ready to show herself off in Ocean’s 8 and at 53, show she’s still as great as ever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=doubled-pamela-anderson>DOUBLED: Pamela Anderson</h2><p>She held off on it for a while but sadly, age is hitting the former beauty hard. In the 1990s, Pamela Anderson was the go-to answer for who was the best looking&nbsp;blonde bombshell on the planet. Her tenure on Baywatch made her an international star. She followed it up with her successful series VIP that showed her fun comic timing off. Anderson also made history with the most Playboy spreads of any celebrity.</p><p>But it appears that her age is catching up to her, and so is the work that she is having done. She did bare all once more in the 2016 drama The People’s Garden and a cameo in last year’s flop Baywatch movie. But recent pictures show an Anderson who looks older with wrinkles and serious sag in that once spectacular form.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hasn-t-aged-halle-berry>HASN’T AGED: Halle Berry</h2><p>To look at Halle Berry today, you’d never think she was 51. The woman had beauty from the start and her first acting role was a short-lived sitcom about models. But she also showed drive with her turn as an addict in Jungle Fever to get attention. That’s served Berry well, mixing up her amazing&nbsp;gorgeous presence with really great acting roles to shine in Hollywood. She made history becoming the first African-American to win the Best Actress Oscar and following it with various good roles. She’s shown a good humor to herself as when she showed up in person to accept her Razzie award for Catwoman.</p><p>Berry continues to impress whether as Storm in X-Men or her TV series Extant. Berry really proved it with a recent Instagram post of herself in just a bikini doing yoga and showing a fantastic toned body. It’s truly hard to tell the difference between Berry today and from the ‘90s to show how well she’s held her looks up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=doubled-lil-kim>DOUBLED: Lil Kim</h2><p>Here’s a clear and obvious case of how&nbsp;having work done can majorly screw up a great lady. Lil Kim was a fantastic talent when she broke out, looking great with her hip hop style and becoming one of the best rappers in the 2000s. She was a very gorgeous lady and stood out as she worked with Christina Aguilera, Maya and Pink on the hit song “Lady Marmalade.”</p><p>However, in 2005, Kim was convicted of perjury and spent a year in prison. Somehow, that did push her new album up and even gave her a stint on Dancing With the Stars. But then Kim began to undergo some work and utterly destroyed her looks. She’s 42 yet appears far older, her great smile now looking&nbsp;terrible and her entire face clearly marred. Throw in weight gains and such and Kim barely looks recognizable to how she once was.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hasn-t-aged-dana-delany>HASN’T AGED: Dana Delany</h2><p>In the 1991 series finale of China Beach, Vietnam War nurse Colleen is shown 25 years after the war, now white-haired and wrinkled. Dana Delany is the first to laugh on that as 27 years after that episode, she barely looks any different. The show made her a star with two Emmy awards. It did take a hit when she starred in the bomb Exit to Eden and while her body looked great bared on camera, it didn’t help the movie. But Delany has bounced back as a fine TV actress.</p><p>She had a good run on Desperate Housewives and then starring on Body of Proof, both roles emphasizing her amazing beauty with a fantastic smile and her lush dark hair. Delany continues to shine in any performance, often showcasing her&nbsp;gorgeous manner and how she can still seduce a guy half her age. She may not as A-list as others but Delany still looks as sensational now as she ever did to showcase how her beauty is ageless.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=doubled-lindsay-lohan>DOUBLED: Lindsay Lohan</h2><p>When hosting Saturday Night Live in 2005, Lindsay Lohan met her “future self” (played by Amy Poehler) who is a total mess and warning of her horrible career choices. When Lohan asks if “I’m happy 30 years from now,” the “older” Lindsay replies “I don’t know, I’m from 2007.” Sadly, that sketch seems far too true to life. It’s easy to forget how lovely and talented Lohan was with her breakouts as a child actress and major success with Mean Girls. She seemed to have it all, a great body, fine talent and a promising future.</p><p>Then came her epic collapse into&nbsp;substance abuse, arrests and more. It’s aged Lohan majorly as at 31, she looks far older. She keeps trying for comebacks but it’s hard to see her rebounding as things have taken a toll on her. It’s sad how SNL predicted Lohan’s fall from a young talent to a woman who looks at least twenty years older than she really is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hasn-t-aged-charlize-theron>HASN’T AGED: Charlize Theron</h2><p>Not only has she not aged, but she seemed to be getting even better. A former model, Charlize Theron made her movie debut in 1996 with 2 Days in the Valley, a crime drama that also boasted the first time she bared all on screen. For a while, Theron was in various roles emphasizing her&nbsp;gorgeous looks such as Reindeer Games and The Italian Job. But it all changed in 2003 when she buried herself into the lead role in Monster, shocking critics with her performance which earned her the Oscar.</p><p>Since then, Theron has continued her great work while still looking flawless in her beauty. In recent years, she’s been remaking herself into an action starlet with Mad Max Fury Road and Atomic Blonde. Both movies boast her looking fabulous while taking part in fantastic and brutal fight scenes. She’s 42 but looks far younger and just as steamy as when she debuted to show that she remains one of the most talented&nbsp;women in Hollywood today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=doubled-goldie-hawn>DOUBLED: Goldie Hawn</h2><p>Once, Goldie Hawn was the single&nbsp;most gorgeous blonde starlet in Hollywood. She came to fame on Laugh-In, the classic sketch comedy show that often had her dancing in a bikini and portraying herself as a bubble-headed moron. But Hawn had true talent, as shown by winning an Oscar for Cactus Flower. She was the star of hits like Private Benjamin, Overboard and others and she and Kurt Russell had probably the best long-lasting non-marriage in Hollywood.</p><p>Sadly, the years have taken its toll on Hawn. She even poked fun at her love for having work done in The First Wives Club but that doesn’t help how bad she looks today. The recent comedy Snatched (her first movie in fifteen years) showed how terrible Hawn looks. That’s especially true compared to her amazing beauty in her prime and a shame this once&nbsp;beautiful blonde turned messy.</p><h2 id=hasn-t-aged-jennifer-lopez>HASN’T AGED: Jennifer Lopez</h2><p>It’s truly astounding that over 20 years since her breakout, Jennifer Lopez still looks as&nbsp;gorgeous as when she came to fame. A former Fly Girl on In Living Color, she started showing off her skills as a singer and dancer. 1997’s Selena got her majorly famous and soon boosting her to multiple fame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In early 2001, she had the best-selling album and the number one movie in the country in the same week. Since then, Lopez has continued to dominate in concert tours, various movies and her current TV show Shades of Blue. But it’s amazing that she shows almost no change from the young star she was, still looking amazing with one of the most rocking bodies on the planet. She keeps in tremendous shape and it shows in her videos as Jenny From the Block maintains a physicality women half her age are jealous of.
