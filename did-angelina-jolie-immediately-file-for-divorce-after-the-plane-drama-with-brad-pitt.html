Except for the statement that the FBI was conducting an investigation, there wasn't much formal information available at the time about the claimed occurrence.</p><h2 id=what-really-happened-during-the-pitt-jolie-plane-incident>What Really Happened During The Pitt-Jolie Plane Incident?</h2><p>Since the day Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pitt, their separation has continued to make headlines. Many are even wondering if the fateful flight ended the couple’s marriage.</p><p>The entire Pitt-Jolie family was flying from Nice, France to Burbank, California on September 14 and stopped to refuel at Minnesota’s International Falls Airport.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the long flight, it was reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pitt was “verbally abusive and physical”</a> with the couple’s six children, Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, and twins Knox and Vivienne.</p><p>An argument between Maddox and his father broke out as the family was returning from a trip to France, suggesting that Pitt’s alcoholism may have had an impact. Sources alleged that the actress grew frustrated and asked her husband to “sober up.”</p><p>However, the incident was so intense that Jolie had no second thoughts about divorcing the A-list actor. Many surmised that the plane drama was the final straw that pushed Jolie to file for divorce that very same week. Few details were known about the incident, though Jolie ended up divorcing her husband.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But in October 2022, <a href=#>a court filing made by the actress revealed more information</a>, including allegations that Pitt got physical with her. The filing says, “Pitt’s aggressive behavior started even before the family got to the airport, with Pitt having a confrontation with one of the children.</p><p>After the flight took off, Jolie approached Pitt and asked him what was wrong. Pitt accused her of being too deferential to the children and verbally attacked her.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Brad Pitt Decided To Make His Health A Priority After Splitting From Angelina Jolie</a></span></p><p>The filing continues, “He pulled her into the bathroom and began yelling at her. Pitt grabbed Jolie by the head and shook her, and then grabbed her shoulders and shook her again before pushing her into the bathroom wall.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The same document alleges that Pitt put his hands on their children during the same incident. “Pitt lunged at his own child and Jolie grabbed him from behind to stop him. To get Jolie off his back, Pitt threw himself backwards into the airplane’s seats injuring Jolie’s back and elbow,” it says.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Brad Pitt Is Accusing Angelina Jolie Of Sabotage</a></span></p><p>The FBI launched an investigation into Brad Pitt following the plane incident in 2016, but they ultimately pressed no charges. Nevertheless, Jolie disagrees with their conclusion as she <a href=#>filed a lawsuit against the FBI in August 2022</a>, demanding the release of information to understand why they failed to arrest him.</p><p>While many have mixed reactions regarding the incident, the estranged couple’s legal battle remains ongoing.</p><h2 id=here-rsquo-s-what-people-think-about-the-plane-incident>Here’s What People Think About The Plane Incident</h2><p>One Redditor commented, “Look something happened on that plane. You do not get off a flight with your husband and children and immediately file for divorce without something big happening. Take some accountability Brad. The court of public sympathy is not going to get you a relationship with your children. Grow up.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another agreed, suggesting that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">there must have been “bad” things</a> that had happened before the plane incident.</p><p>“I agree, and I also think things must have been bad before then for a while also. I think children who have a close bond with a parent for many years, and then one instance of something truly horrible happens, would in some cases come around to seeing them again. Like, if he had been a good parent I think at least one our of the kids would forgive him I guess. So I think he was probably an abusive alcoholic for years and that’s why when the plane thing happened, they knew it wasn’t a one time thing, it was just how he is.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amidst the abuse allegations, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source for Brad Pitt has spoken out</a>.</p><p>The source said, “It’s incredibly said that she continues to rehash, revise and reimagine her description of an event that happened 6 years ago, adding in completely untrue information to try to get additional attention for herself at the expense of their family. She had the opportunity to share information with law enforcement who made the decision not to press charges.”</p><p>The source continued, “She had the chance to share this during the lengthy custody trial, which resulted in the judge granting 50-50 custody to Pitt. She has resorted to trying to keep rehashing the same thing. Going back to the same thing month after month with new and still false information for purposes that only she can understand.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the source chose to remain unnamed, they assert that the claims made by Angelina Jolie are false. Furthermore, they assert that this has already been partially established in court during the conflict between the two actors over custody of their children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdlruoscuipZplmqS5qrGMn6ClnV2bvLN5w6KtqKqTmnqnvs6mZJuqkZl6sbXTrWSanqSav268y5qlnmWkp7axew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-iannetta-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Iannetta Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
