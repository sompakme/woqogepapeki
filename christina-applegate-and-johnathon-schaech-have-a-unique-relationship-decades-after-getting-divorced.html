The actress has been through so much, and <a href=#>Applegate even suffered from another disease</a> in the past. While no one would blame her for being angry and bitter, she has remained fairly positive while discussing her diagnosis while still keeping it real.</p><p>In countless interviews, Christina Applegate has shared that her husband Martyn LeNoble has been there for her in the wake of her health issue. Many of the Married... with Children star's fans might not know that she was married once before in the mid-2000s. Christina Applegate and her first husband Johnathon Schaech have an interesting relationship that is different than people might expect.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-christina-applegate-and-johnathon-schaech-39-s-relationship-like-today>What Is Christina Applegate And Johnathon Schaech's Relationship Like Today?</h2><p>Christina Applegate's fans were thrilled when she was one of the <strong>2024 Emmy Awards presenters</strong>. According to Page Six, she walked with a cane that said "FU MS" and received a standing ovation from the crowd. While she said that people didn't need to clap for her, she seemed touched by the positive reception that she got.</p><p><strong>Christina Applegate's first husband </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Johnathon Schaech</strong> also complimented her</a>, which was sweet to see. He shared a picture of the actress on his Instagram Stories and wrote “We are so proud of you, Christina.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/christina-applegate-johnathon-schaech.jpg><p>Schaech also said:</p><p>"She danced opening night on broadway on a broken foot!

Many celebrities have rough and intense divorces and never speak to each other again. It's hard to imagine that most people would feel comfortable being so public about how much they care about their ex-spouse, especially because both Applegate and Schaech are famous actors. While some might want to keep their divorce entirely private, he wanted to support Applegate, which is really sweet.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/how-christina-applegate-really-felt-about-working-with-the-cast-of-friends.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Christina Applegate Really Felt About Working With The Cast Of Friends</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Christina Applegate's relationship with the cast of Friends runs a lot deeper than most fans know.</span><p>According to Us Weekly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Schaech talked about Applegate</a> in 2022 when speaking to his second wife, actress and musician Jana Kramer.

While Applegate doesn't seem to have talked about her divorce, at least not in recent years, Schaech has continually said that he cares about her a lot.
