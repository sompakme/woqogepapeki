The 95 year old musical legend is in the midst of a tour alongside <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the incredible Lady Gaga</a>, but sadly, will not be able to see it through. Bennett's son has come forward to update the public about his famous father's sudden pull-back from performing. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> quotes him as saying; "This was a hard decision for us to to make, as he is a capable performer. This is, however, doctors' orders. His continued health is the most important part of this, and when we heard the doctors -- when Tony's wife, Susan heard them -- she said, 'Absolutely not.' He'll be doing other things, but not those upcoming shows."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Quentin Tarantino Stands Firm On Retirement After Next Film</a></span></p><p>Tony Bennett recorded his first hit single in 1951 and has been entertaining the masses for an astounding 7 decades. His legendary hit singles and his iconic career have been idolized by many, and respected by all. There's simply no denying the massive impact his music has had in the industry, and in spite of this announcement just being released, he is already greatly missed.</p><p>Eager fans had already purchased tickets to watch Bennett take the live stage with Lady Gaga, but the decision to retire from live music was one that couldn't wait, and with very little notice, he pulled out of his contracts to sing live.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bennett was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease</a> in 2016, but seems to have been managing fairly well since then. His son insists that it's not the actual live singing and performing that is problematic, but rather the toll that touring and traveling has on his body.</p><p>Understandably, living out of a suitcase and having to adjust to new surroundings at each tour stop was sure to be exhausting for the 95 year old star, and that lifestyle lacked the structure and familiarity that he needs at this stage in his life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> reported the painful announcement made by Tony Bennett's son, where he went on to explain by saying;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Look, he gets tired. The decision is being made that doing concerts now is just too much for him. We don't want him to fall on stage, for instance -- something as simple as that."</p><p>In spite of being upset at not getting to&nbsp;experience Tony Bennett's live performance on stage one last time, fans are understanding of the fact that this is the best decision based on his age and health.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox News</a>, affected performances include; "New York, Maryland, Connecticut, Arizona, Oklahoma and Canada. Ticket holders should check with the local venues for information regarding refunds."</p><p>Bennett is far from finished with music, and is expected to continue to pursue his passion, the only difference being the live performance element of his career coming to a close.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Visible Touch: The Incredible Career Of Phil Collins</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox News</a>,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> TMZ</a>,</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBsLrYZpmepp6awbV50Z6roqqVYrmqwsRmpK6rmZh6tbvUq6Cnn18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-most-expensive-things-chris-rock-has-bought.html><span>←</span><span>10 Most Expensive Things Chris Rock Has Bought</span></a>
