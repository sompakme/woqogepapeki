This high price tag may be shocking, considering the architect has gotten flack for barely wearing anything during public appearances. Some of her recent looks include catsuits made from pantyhose, so the sheer, limited fabric has some fans questioning how the looks can cost so much.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Bianca has made odd choices that are not particularly flattering, cool, or sophisticated," stylist Amanda Sanders told the publication. "There is no rhyme or reason to any of her fashion choices.”</p><p>“Kanye does have endless money, so she could certainly be expressive in what she is wearing and have a wide choice - whatever the message is that she has been trying to get out,” she continued.</p><p>While some reports claim <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kanye is controlling Bianca’s behavior and outfit choices</a>, even seeming to spark concern amongst her family, there’s also speculation that her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">daring looks have been part of a larger PR stunt</a> to support Ye’s comeback.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/screen-shot-2023-12-18-at-8-31-30-am.png> Kanye West&nbsp; <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What can’t be doubted is that Bianca’s pricey looks have caused controversy. Last year, reports <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">suggested she could face a fine or even jail time</a> for public indecency after Bianca’s nude looks stirred backlash in Italy.</p><p>Following a series of controversial behavior, including antisemitic comments, <a href=#>Kanye faced a wave of expensive lawsuits</a>. He also lost various deal that deteriorated his net worth, including his long-standing Adidas anad Yeezy collab, <a href=#>which cost him his billionaire status</a>.</p><p>Ealrier this year, Kanye admitted he was nearing bankruptcy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">before reportedly making $19 million in Yeezy sales</a> following his Super Bowl ad, which was filmed selfie style in a low-budget (but apparently effective) manner.</p><p>There have been claims that <a href=#>Kanye is worried about how much Bianca is spending</a>, and it seems true that she does have expensive taste in clothing, if The Sun’s estimates are true. But if Ye’s finances are on the up again, as he says, perhaps the former billionaire can afford his wife’s expensive outfits, even if they continue to cause controversy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmm6GRo7CiecKepaynop56tLnApaNmnp%2Bnwba6xGaZmqqVocZuwMeeqZ5ln6rBp7XTrGSkmZ6usm6%2BxJumrqaUqHqvscCrZJuZnqC%2FtrzTnLBo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./argentina-greece-jun-21-1994-world-cup-1994-match-sheet.html><span>←</span><span>Argentina - Greece, Jun 21, 1994 - World Cup 1994 - Match sheet</span></a>
