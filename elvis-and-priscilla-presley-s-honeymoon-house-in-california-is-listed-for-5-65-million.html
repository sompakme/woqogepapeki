The home where Elvis and Priscilla Presley celebrated their honeymoon, known as the “House of Tomorrow,” just hit the market. The 4,695-square-foot, four-bedroom, five-bathroom structure sports a unique profile made up of four circular sections under a dramatically angular sloped roof, designed by Modernist architect William Krisel, who was known for his innovative tract housing.</p><p>The contemporary-style home was built in 1960 for Bob Alexander, who owned a construction company that developed thousands of homes in Palm Springs and the nearby Vista Las Palmas. At the time, the home was heralded as a landmark representing the future of home design. Its electronic temperature controls and outdoor lighting and sprinkler systems were cutting-edge for the era. In 1962, <i>Look</i> magazine described the structure as a “$300,000 pleasure dome that proves California has only begun to show how luxurious things can be on this planet,” per <a href=#><i>Architectural Digest</i></a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Last purchased for $2.6 million in 2020, the house underwent extensive renovations and restorations over the last two years while staying faithful to its original design, earning a historic site designation. Inside, the midcentury abode’s circular rooms are lined with exposed-rock walls and floor-to-ceiling glass. A 60-foot-long cream couch follows the living room’s curvature, enveloping a floating hearth topped by an eye-catching beaker-shaped white steel fireplace hood that juts out of the ceiling. A matching hood tops the circular kitchen island, which houses five gas burners and is lined in light wood paneling. A connecting living room boasts a fireplace and opens to the pentagon-shaped pool outside via sliding glass doors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/633caded35df27045802bca8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ML_Ladera_0922_084.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Upstairs, the primary bedroom is lined with windows, offering sweeping views of the palm-tree-dotted property and nearby mountains.
