Hit 2000 film Miss Congeniality follows FBI agent Gracie (<a href=#><strong>Sandra Bullock</strong></a>) as she goes undercover at a beauty pageant in order to prove herself at work to her male counterparts (played by <a href=#><strong>Benjamin Bratt</strong></a> and <strong>Ernie Hudson</strong>).</p><p>Since she’s been a tomboy her whole life, the head of the pageant, Kathy Morningside (<strong>Candice Bergen</strong>), enlists expert Victor Melling (<strong>Michael Caine</strong>) to get Gracie ready for competition through quite an intense makeover process. Throughout the movie, the cop forms unexpected friendships, romances and is shocked when she’s able to uncover the life-threatening events happening at the pageant.</p><p>In 2000, <a href=#><strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong></a> revealed in an interview that the rom-com was actually based on her.</p><p>“When I was getting ready to cohost the Emmys, the writer saw me [on TV] learning how to walk in a dress and heels,” she shared with <a href=#>Parade magazine at the time</a>. “My stylist at the time — a man — was teaching me, and it was hilarious. The Miss Congeniality writer saw it and thought it was brilliant.”</p><p>Despite it being based on the TV host, Bullock also closely related to Grace, later admitting that doing the combat scenes — and she did many of her own stunts — were easier than the pageant scenes. Additionally, she told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> that she tried to cut the swimsuit scene.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“That was a huge bone of contention for me. I was trying to get it written out so many times,” the Speed actress shared. ‘It’s in the script. We already shot it—outside in San Antonio.”</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to see what the cast is up to today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BitrS%2FjJymp5%2BVo7aiuMitsGabkajBbsPHnqmeZZGnsm7Ax56wZqafrHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./family-guy-brian-griffin-returns-back-from-the-dead.html><span>←</span><span> 'Family Guy' -- Brian Griffin Returns ...
