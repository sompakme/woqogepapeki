From a relatively meager budget of about $7 million, the David Mickey Evans film returned a gross of $34 million at the box office and received generally positive reviews from critics. In the years that have followed, however, The Sandlot's popularity has shot through the roof, becoming a bona fide cult classic. In 2018, the main <a href=#>cast reunited to celebrate the movie's 25th anniversary</a> and to talk about how their lives had evolved since then.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Among those who turned up for this reunion was Marty York, who <a href=#>portrayed the popular Alan 'Yeah-Yeah' McClennan in the film</a>. York revealed that fans were still enamored with his character and the catchphrase, more than two decades later. "I can't walk through a Las Vegas casino without someone yelling 'Yeah-Yeah!'," he revealed.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>You're Not Ready For These Pics Of The Sandlot Cast Today</a></span></p><p>With the picture now just one year shy of turning 30, we take a look at all the main characters and how they have done for themselves financially since the film premiered.</p><h2 id=tom-guiry---100-000><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Tom Guiry - $100,000</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>New Jersey-born Tom Guiry had the privilege of playing the lead role in The Sandlot, as Scott Smalls. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The plot follows Smalls</a> as his family moves into a new L.A. suburb, and he tries to fit in with neighborhood kids who play baseball at a local sandlot.</p><p>In the three decades that have followed, Guiry has continued acting, although his career has been slightly underwhelming. His most recent role was a secondary one, as Keith Whelan in Sandra Bullock's The Unforgivable. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Guiry is currently worth around $100,000.</a></p><h2 id=patrick-renna---1-5-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Patrick Renna - $1.5 Million</span></h2><p>One of the most outstanding characters in The Sandlot was Ham Porter, the team catcher. The part was played impressively by 14-year-old actor Patrick Renna. It was his first ever film or TV role, but he has since landed multiple recurring roles on shows like Judging Amy and Boston Legal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's What Ham Porter From 'The Sandlot' Looks Like Today</a></span></p><p>Renna's net worth as of February 2022 is<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> approximately $1.5 million.</a></p><h2 id=mike-vitar---300-000><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Mike Vitar - $300,000</span></h2><p>Unlike Guiry and Renna, 43-year-old Mike Vitar has not persisted with acting, and in fact, works today as a firefighter in the Los Angeles Fire Department. Apart from The Sandlot, Vitar made cameos in a few more movies and TV shows, before he hung up his boots soon after, in 1997.</p><p>In the film, he played Benny Rodriguez, the team's best player and leader. His current <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth is about three times that of Guiry, at $300,000.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chauncey-leopardi---3-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Chauncey Leopardi - $3 Million</span></h2><p>Chauncey Leopardi portrayed the naughty and innovative Michael 'Squints' Palledorous. As it turns out, his real-life character was not very different. As the crew struggled to keep the kids disciplined on set, it was Leopardi who reportedly <a href=#>demanded to be 'bribed' before they could fall in line</a>.</p><p>Leopardi is said to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">worth $3 million at the moment,</a> although he has not appeared in any screen production since Coldwater in 2013.</p><h2 id=james-earl-jones---40-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>James Earl Jones - $40 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There is no question that of all the people who featured in The Sandlot, none is more famous and accomplished than James Earl Jones. The actor is best known for his work in Coming to America, Star Wars and as the voice of Mufasa in The Lion King, among others.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Fans Thought James Earl Jones Passed Away When He Was Still Very Much Alive</a></span></p><p>At 91 years of age today, Jones has amassed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a huge net worth, of about $40 million.</a></p><h2 id=marty-york---200-000><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Marty York - $200,000</span></h2><p>Marty York is another one who has not found acting gigs that easy to come by since he starred in The Sandlot. Despite his admission that he still gets recognized as 'Yeah-Yeah' today, York has a<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> net worth of only about $200,000 to show for his career.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 41-year-old was last seen on the screen as a character simply called Creep in an episode of the Showtime sitcom, SMILF.</p><h2 id=brandon-quintin-adams---300-000><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Brandon Quintin Adams - $300,000</span></h2><p>While Brandon Quintin Adams is mostly acknowledged for playing Kenny DeNunez in The Sandlot, he is perhaps just as well-known as Jesse Hall in Disney's The Mighty Ducks franchise. The Kansas-born actor also has credits in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, as well as the horror comedy film, The People Under the Stairs.</p><p>With<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> a net worth of about $300,000</a>, Adams might also be recognizable from Michael Jackson's experimental anthology musical film, Moonwalker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=karen-allen---10-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Karen Allen - $10 Million</span></h2><p>Like James Earl Jones, Karen Allen already had an established career by the time she featured in The Sandlot: She had worked with Harrison Ford <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">as Marion Ravenwood in Raiders of the Lost Ark</a> in 1981, and then later on in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull in 2008.</p><p>In the David Mickey Evans movie, she plays Scott's mother, Mrs. Smalls.
