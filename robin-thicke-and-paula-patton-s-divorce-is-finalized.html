However, the two will share custody of their four-year-old son Julian.</p><p>Patton has kept a tight lip on the parting since the news of the divorce broke. But the actress recently appeared on <a href=# rel=nofollow>Good Morning America</a> and said, “I mean, the honest truth is it has been challenging, but it’s been a year of growth, lots of healing, learning about all new things, but I’ve come out of it stronger,” Patton admitted.</p><p>In July 2014, Thicke debuted his seventh studio album titled Paula, with a tracklist that was geared towards his now ex-wife, like “Get Her Back,” and “Forever Love.” In an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow>Ryan Seacrest</a>, Thicke said, “I wrote all the songs in about three weeks and we recorded the album in about a month. Obviously all the songs were about her or about how I feel about her. A lot of songwriters have done this kind of thing before. They won’t tell you in the title or they’ll be suggestive … I was just like, ‘There’s no reason to hide who this is about.’ It’s all about her.” — Richy Rosario</p><p>Photo Credit: Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6e8o7XNZquhoZOgsm6tzZ1kqZmloa5uvMCtq6imo2KxqsLOq5qeZZmoeqe1zZqjorKVmXp0f5Ruamln</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./norm-macdonald-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html><span>←</span><span>Norm MacDonalds Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</span></a>
