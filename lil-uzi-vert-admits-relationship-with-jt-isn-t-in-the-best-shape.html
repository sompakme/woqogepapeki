On Thursday (Oct. 26), the Philadelphia rapper updated his fans on his well-being in his Instagram Story. They admitted that they’re mentally going through a stressful time that has impacted all of the relationships around them. Uzi then expressed that they wanted to complete their last album so that they could get back to living a normal life.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Life is becoming so different. Hopefully for the better,” their series of Stories began. “This time I won’t stop my journey to happiness or being one of the greatest musicians ever. My last album will definitely help you remember who is the one. Thank you.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">They then addressed claims that they were trying to use their stress for “attention.” Uzi expressed that dropping music is the only way they can drum up real attention. As they continued, the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>“I Just Wanna Rock” artist </a>opened up about feeling alone.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The most attention I could get is by dropping music,” they added. “I understand y’all don’t believe me, but it starts with me 2 show you that I’m actually serious. I’m very stressed out and done with so many voice’s controlling my life. It’s like I never lived for me. I would give up all the money and perks that this comes with 2 live a perfectly normal life. I’m okay with it…After that I finally can genuinely smile.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screen-Shot-2023-10-27-at-11.34.19-AM.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Im not as close to my family as I should be. My relationship isn’t in the best shape. I JUST WANNA BREATHE… I’ve been distant from everyone lately, even if they are standing right next to me.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Vert’s IG Stories arrived after <a href=# id=auto-tag_aap-bari data-tag=aap-bari>A$AP Bari</a> claimed that JT got <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">upset at the Philly rapper</a> over <a href=# id=auto-tag_ice-spice data-tag=ice-spice>Ice Spice</a> at the 2023 BET Awards.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">On Thursday (Oct. 26), JT told <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>The Breakfast Club </a>that she was upset at her significant other that night because Uzi gave her seat to Bari. “You should have made sure I had that seat,” she said. “It was never about another artist.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Bari responded online, telling the Florida entertainer to “stop lying.” “He ain’t want you [sitting] there, dumb bi**h. Stop lying. She was really mad about Ice Spice, not about me. She called him a groupie <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>’cause he was sitting next to her</a>,” he said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6G2rXnUs6BmrpWnwW6202apnqSRqbawutKhoKllYWeAdYSPb25pbF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-travolta-wiki-what-s-his-ethnicity-religion-and-family-details.html><span>←</span><span>John Travolta Wiki: Whats His Ethnicity?
