Alexander spoke highly of the former MLW World Champion and said that he’s an incredible talent that exemplifies what a pro wrestler should be.</p><p>“Well, Jacob Fatu’s been on my radar for the past five years. I wrestle at a place in Chicago called AAW, and they used to book him pretty regularly. I believe he was their champion for a period of time. I remember maybe like three years ago, I was just shooting the breeze with Scott D’Amore,” Alexander explained, “and I told him if I was starting a company, Jacob Fatu would be one of the first two draft picks for me.</p><p>“I just think he checks all the boxes for a professional wrestler, be it athleticism, physicality, charisma, presence, all this other stuff. I’m a huge fan of Jacob Fatu,” Alexander stated. “I think that as much as I’m eager to get out there at the Ric Flair show and show the world what I can do, I think he’s going to be the exact same.”</p><p>The match is not only a chance to see two of the top athletes from IMPACT Wrestling and MLW square off, but it’s also the first time that Fatu and Alexander have ever competed against each other. Alexander said that the match has fallen through in the past, but now he can’t wait to finally square off with Fatu and represent IMPACT on such a big stage.</p><p>“I’m chomping at the bit to get there because it’s a first time ever match up with the two of us. We’ve had it booked a few times and it’s always falling through due to travel issues or whatever else. But you know, to be able to go in and represent IMPACT Wrestling, to do it against an MLW talent,” Alexander said, “just us dipping our toes into different swimming pools and stuff like that and showing what we can do and representing our company. As much as professional wrestling is professional wrestling, it adds a competitive edge to it. And I’m somebody that’s very competitive, so I think it’s only going to help benefit everybody. For it to be on Ric Flair’s last show, it’s a big deal, but I’m very excited to be a part of it. I’m very excited to represent IMPACT Wrestling.”</p><p>Check out the latest on Ric Flair’s Last Match and <a href=# rel=noopener>Starrcast V</a> in Nashville at .</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJpbnFsZGK3sL%2FHZpilnaiWu6Wx0Wahmpufl3qnrdOuZKyskae%2FpK3SrWSmmaSYtQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./did-harper-sleep-with-cameron-a-glance-at-public-s-favourite-drama.html><span>←</span><span>Did Harper Sleep With Cameron?
