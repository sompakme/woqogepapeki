At one point during the sit-down, Dash recalled an instance in which he physically assaulted Stoute, alleging that the executive did nothing in return.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I smacked him and sh*t and I gave him an opportunity to have a fair one. So like—pop!—smacked him.” According to the Harlem native, he then offered Stoute a chance at a fair fight, a proposal which the former manager declined.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“He asked me, he said, ‘Yo, did you just smack me?’ I was like, ‘Yeah, ni**a and ain’t nothing between us but the wind. I’ll give you a fair one,'” Dash continued, adding that he damaged an expensive <a href=# id=auto-tag_watch data-tag=watch>watch</a> he was wearing in the process. “I had a Franck Muller [watch] on my [left arm]—crack!—and sh*t just broke,” he said of the pricey timepiece.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Elsewhere in the episode, Dash voiced his frustration with being mentioned by his former colleagues and associates in the media in an unflattering way. “To be honest, I’m sick of these n***as,” the 52-year-old expressed. “I’m sick of it because you would think that after a while n***as would leave you alone.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He continued, adding, “But this consistent thing where people feel comfortable saying that they’re going to do whatever they want to do or can do to keep me out of business, talk bad about me to other people you know come together and make a certain narrative and then get on TV and then have the nerve to speak on it…I’m sick of that sh*t.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">VIBE has reached out to Stoute for comment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-472462646.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Dash’s latest revelation comes after Stoute’s recent appearance on Shannon Sharpe’s Club Shay Shay podcast, during which he attributed Dash’s split with JAY-Z to <a href=#>his ego and volatile temperament</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The people around him wanted to meet with other people. People were becoming less beholden to him but he was unaware of it,” Stoute said. “And then while he was building businesses, he would go off all around the world with cameras and girls and all kinds of crazy shit, and then come back flipping on everybody as if [they were wrong].”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">See Damon Dash’s Relate to Great podcast episode below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5murrGMnZisoF2ouqKvyp6bZqukmsOmedKtpq6slWKwqa3LpZynn5WZeqe1xqGrZmliaIF5gpBxaWln</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-perez-on-honouring-celebrating-his-late-wife-selena-quintanilla-s-legacy.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Perez On Honouring Celebrating His Late Wife Selena Quintanillas Legacy</span></a>
