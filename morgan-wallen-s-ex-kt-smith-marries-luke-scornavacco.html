<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Morgan Wallen's Ex KT Smith Marries Luke Scornavacco</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><a href=#><strong>Morgan Wallen</strong></a>’s ex-fiancée, <a href=#><strong>Katie “KT” Smith,</strong></a> has found new love with <strong>Luke Scornavacco</strong>.</p><p>Smith announced via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> that she and Scornavacco tied the knot just days after announcing their engagement on March 30. “Swipe for a surprise 🤎🌼,” Smith captioned an April 4 slideshow featuring a farm photo shoot of the duo and <a href=#>Smith’s son</a>, Indigo, 3, whom she shares with Wallen, 30.</p><p>Smith broke her marriage news in the post’s last slide by sharing a snap of herself holding a marriage certificate with her new husband. While details of the couple’s wedding are unknown, Smith sported what looked like a white wedding dress when Scornavacco popped the question less than a week prior.</p><p>“Why save the good things for later ❤️‍🔥,” Smith <a href=# rel=noopener>captioned pics</a> of their picturesque engagement. In contrast to Smith’s white ensemble, Scornavacco sported an all-black outfit and cowboy hat for the big day. He got down on one knee in a gorgeous white barn decorated with an aisle lined with flowers and a floral arch.</p><p>Smith gave fans another look at her March 29 proposal by sharing a video of the sweet moment, which began with them looking at photo tables before walking down the aisle. “03/29/24: when dreams turned to reality ✨,” she captioned the April 2 <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> clip. “Also, shoutout @brilliantearth for leveling up what we ever thought a dream ring could be 🫶🏼.”</p><p>Smith and Scornavacco went public with their relationship in May 2023. “Found my 4 leaf clover ❤️,” Scornavacco <a href=# rel=noopener>captioned a selfie</a> with Smith, who was holding a four-leaf clover. The pair enjoyed a trip to the beach the following month, each sharing pics from their vacation via social media. “Wouldn’t wanna do life with anyone else❤️,” Scornavacco <a href=# rel=noopener>wrote at the time</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Morgan-Wallen-Ex-KT-Smith-Ties-the-Knot-With-Luke-Scornavacco.jpg><p>Smith previously dated Wallen from 2017 to 2019 and welcomed their son in July 2020. “Little Wilder, I’m a changed man. Since you came into the world Friday, I see mine differently now,” the country star captioned an <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> pic of himself holding his then-newborn son. “It’s not just me anymore, and I’m glad it’s not. This year has been the hardest of my life in so many ways, but that’s not what I will remember it by.”</p><p>Two months before becoming a father, Wallen was arrested for public intoxication and disorderly conduct in Nashville. Days after Smith’s wedding news broke, he was arrested again for allegedly <a href=#>throwing a chair</a> off a six-story rooftop bar. <a href=# rel=noopener>News Channel 5 Nashville</a> reported on Monday, April 8, that the “Last Night” singer was charged with three felony counts of reckless endangerment and disorderly conduct.</p><p>“At 10:53pm Sunday evening Morgan Wallen was arrested in downtown Nashville for reckless endangerment and disorderly conduct,” Wallen’s lawyer, <strong>Worrick Robinson</strong>, said in a statement to the local news outlet. “He is cooperating fully with authorities.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamp6Kcrq951pqjpZ2eqHqmxIykq2arnZ7BqXnMmqmroZWoeq3Byp5krJufp7uiwsCcmqhn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./laurie-hernandez-details-post-gymnastics-life-with-partner-charlotte.html><span>←</span><span>Laurie Hernandez Details Post-Gymnastics Life With Partner Charlotte</span></a>
