The California native initially got her start in acting when she was cast in a variety of national commercials and landed a guest spot on the 1987 sitcom Valerie.</p><p>In 1987, Sweetin found her big break after she nabbed the role of Stephanie Tanner in Full House, which ran until 1995.</p><p>While Sweetin took time off from acting in order to attend Chapman University following her time on Full House, she returned to television as a host for the second season of Fuse’s dance competition show, Pants-Off-Dance-Off. She also starred in various independent films and landed a role in the television pilot, Small Bits of Happiness, which won Best Comedy at the 3rd Annual Independent Television Festival.</p><p>In 2009, Sweetin penned her memoir, unSweetined, which chronicled her life with alcohol and drug addiction. In the book, she details her use of ecstasy, methamphetamines, crack and alcohol, which she began taking when she was only 14. In 2008, Sweetin got sober for good and began working as a clinical logistics coordinator at a Los Angeles drug rehab center. She completed her degree as a drug and alcohol counselor and has become a public advocate for recovery from addiction.</p><p>In 2015, Sweetin announced she would reprise her role as Stephanie Tanner in the Netflix spin-off series Fuller House, which ended after five seasons in 2020. In 2017, she starred alongside <a href=#><strong>Beverley Mitchell</strong></a> in Hollywood Darlings, an unscripted docu-comedy series for Pop, where she played an exaggerated version of herself. She also was a contestant on season 22 of Dancing With the Stars, where she finished in sixth place.</p><p>Sweetin tied the knot with her first husband <strong>Shaun Holguin</strong> in 2002, but the two divorced in 2006. The actress moved on with <strong>Cody Herpin</strong> less than a year later. In July 2007, the pair married in Las Vegas and welcomed daughter Zoie in 2008. However, they split shortly after their daughter was born.</p><p>In April 2010, Sweetin and boyfriend <strong>Morty Coyle</strong> announced they were expecting their first child together, daughter Beatrix. The two tied the knot in 2012 but divorced four years later. In 2016, Sweetin announced her engagement to<strong> Justin Hodak</strong>, but the two called it quits one year later. In July 2022, Sweetin married social worker <strong>Mescal Wasilewski</strong>.</p><p>One month earlier, Sweetin was shoved to the ground by members of the Las Angeles Police Department while&nbsp;protesting for abortion rights in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe vs. Wade. While the actress wasn’t badly injured, the LAPD released a statement saying their use of force would be “evaluated” going forward.</p><span>More ▾</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOinKxnmqSxqrGMrK6enaSeu3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./here-s-the-real-reason-adam-driver-joined-the-marines.html><span>←</span><span>Here's The Real Reason Adam Driver Joined The Marines</span></a>
