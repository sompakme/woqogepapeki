I guess I got so wrapped up in all this other s–t that I never really got a chance to sit back and apologize to you. I really do want you to know that I am sorry.”</p><p>Jackson replied, “I felt like the whole relationship was not real by the way you handled it ending — and that killed me.”</p><p>When Federline continued to apologize, noting that he “got caught up in [his] own selfishness,” the Celebrity Rap Superstar alum told him that his words “meant the world” to her.</p><p>As for the Excess Baggage alum and Spears, the duo wed in October 2004 but finalized their divorce three years later. Ahead of calling it quits, the former couple <a href=#>welcomed sons Sean Preston and Jayden in September 2005 and 2006</a>, respectively.</p><p>The Crossroads star, who has since moved on with fiancé<a href=#><strong> Sam Asghari</strong></a>,<a href=#> complimented Jackson’s daughter on her drawing skills</a> in a March 2022 Instagram post.</p><p>“My son’s stepsister drew this!!!” the songwriter captioned a photo of a sketch at the time. “Kori … she makes me feel so stupid. I think she was 12 when she did this. I’ve kept it all this time. She did it by hand not tracing!!! I would get a 40 percent F if I got graded on drawing!!! I respect people who can draw like this. My son can do the same thing. I mean wow. Wow!!!”</p><p>Jackson commented on the social media upload: “So crazy you posted this now because she’s working on a new one for you.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In addition to the Massachusetts native and Spears, Federline has two daughters with Prince. The pair <a href=#>wed in August 2013 in Las Vegas</a>. Two years before their nuptials, the couple welcomed daughter Jordan. Peyton was born in April 2014.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see photos of Federline’s family members over the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkuKbCyKdkn52Umr%2Bttc2eqmaanJq7pbHDZp2apZmhxm65xJ6rZqCZqHp3ecKhoKWcopq7bsDHnqCrZZ2kurR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jalen-green-tattoos-draya-michele-s-name-on-him-so-we-know-it-s-real.html><span>←</span><span>Jalen Green Tattoos Draya Michele's Name On Him So We Know It's Real</span></a>
