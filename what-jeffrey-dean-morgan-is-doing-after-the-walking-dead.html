He played the father figure John Winchester to the leads of Supernatural, and in the medical drama he played the sweet, fan-favorite Denny Duquette. Now that The Walking Dead is over, something he has been a part of for years, fans wonder what Jeffrey Dean Morgan will be doing next.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>8 Of The Most Controversial Walking Dead Moments</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-jeffrey-dean-morgan><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Who Is Jeffrey Dean Morgan?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/TWD-TLDR-4-NY-Times-1.jpg><p>Jeffrey Dean Morgan is a highly successful television actor. He has dabbled in film over the years, including his leading role in the movie The Postcard Killings and roles in Fall, The Unholy, and Walkaway Joe. In recent years, his time has been taken up by The Walking Dead, which recently came to an end in 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Behind the scenes, Morgan is happily married to One Tree Hill star Hilarie Burton. The two were introduced by Morgan’s Supernatural co-star Jensen Ackles and his wife Danneel Haris, who also worked on One Tree Hill. Despite having a 16 year age gap, Morgan and Burton fell madly in love. The celebrity couple were married in 2019 and have two children together, <a href=#>Augustus and George</a>.</p><h2 id=what-is-jeffrey-dean-morgan-known-for><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>What Is Jeffrey Dean Morgan Known For?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/jeffrey-dean-morgan-and-katherine-heigl.png><p>Recently, Jeffrey Dean Morgan’s name has been interlinked with the popular supernatural drama The Walking Dead. He played a lead character on the show from 2016 until the show’s end in 2022. Before joining the cast, however, Morgan was already well-established in the world of television.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other than The Walking Dead, Morgan is known for his roles in Supernatural and Grey’s Anatomy. Morgan was prominently featured in the first season of the CW’s Supernatural first season in 2005. He played John Winchester, father to main characters Sam and Dean Winchester. Though he only appeared in two episodes after the first season, including the show’s 300th episode, he had a strong impact on the show. In Grey’s Anatomy, <a href=#>Morgan played Katherine Heigl’s love interest Denny Duquette</a> for a while before his character’s death. He returned as a hallucination later on in the show. Morgan has also had recurring roles in shows like The Good Wife and Weeds.</p><h2 id=jeffrey-dean-morgan-in-the-walking-dead><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jeffrey Dean Morgan In The Walking Dead</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jeffrey Dean Morgan is very well-known for his role of Negan in The Walking Dead. The show originally started in 2010, but Morgan did not join the cast until 2016. Despite being a late addition, Morgan and his character became strong components of the show and he remained a cast member until the show came to an end in 2022.</p><p>His first appearance on the show was in the season 6 finale in April 2016. His true introduction did not come until that fall in season 7, when Negan brutally murdered beloved character Glenn in a scene considered to be the most graphic and horrific of the entire show. He continued to play a villain throughout seasons 7 and 8, but going into the 9th season, Negan became a sort of anti-hero who eventually earned a spot in the hero group.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Did Andrew Lincoln Make From The Walking Dead?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-jeffrey-morgan-almost-quit-the-walking-dead><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Did Jeffrey Morgan Almost Quit The Walking Dead?</span></h2><p>Jeffrey Dean Morgan loved playing Negan on The Walking Dead. The character, being a villain and ultimately an anti-hero, is very different than what Morgan was originally known for in Supernatural and Grey’s Anatomy. He had no plans of leaving The Walking Dead, but he did question if he should continue to play Negan in the upcoming spinoff, especially considering how the news of the new show was handled.</p><p>“<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">That’s not the way we should have gone about it</a>,” Morgan said in reference to the spinoff series being announced before the end of The Walking Dead. He felt it took a lot of suspense out of the final season. The actor also was planning on not reprising his role of Negan. “If you had told me that a year ago that I would be doing it, I would’ve said, ‘There’s no way. I’m going to end this and walk away.’ The new adventure awaits doing something else.” Ultimately, Morgan “felt invigorated and wanted to continue” telling the story of Negan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jeffrey-dean-morgan-wants-to-spend-more-time-with-family><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Jeffrey Dean Morgan Wants To Spend More Time With Family</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hilarie-burton-jeffrey-dean-morgan.jpg><p>Jeffrey Dean Morgan has been filming The Walking Dead for six years. Filming for the series occurred in Georgia, mostly on sound studios which are not open to the public. The filming process for a series has many long hours, especially when action sequences are involved like in The Walking Dead. The process forms close friendships between cast members, similar to how the cast of the new Netflix original show That 90’s Show are all best friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Morgan formed close relationships with his cast mates on The Walking Dead, he missed out on a lot of quality time with his family. He is married to One Tree Hill actress Hilarie Burton and together they have two young children, Augustus and George. In 2018, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Morgan and Burton relocated from Los Angeles to live on a farm, called Mischief Farm, in Rhinebeck, New York</a>. The separation was difficult, but now that Morgan will be in New York for the filming of his new show The Walking Dead: Dead City, Morgan is able to spend more time with his family.</p><h2 id=jeffrey-dean-morgan-on-the-big-screen-in-neponset-circle><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Jeffrey Dean Morgan On The Big Screen In Neponset Circle</span></h2><p>With The Walking Dead coming to an end in 2022, Jeffrey Dean Morgan is able to tackle new projects. As an actor, Morgan always wants to try something new, whether that be a new genre or a new type of character. Since he is also more well-known for his work in television instead of his work in film, Morgan wanted to give movies another try.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Supernatural actor is set to star as the lead in the upcoming film Neponset Circle. The film will be a crime thriller telling the story of detective Jimmy O’Mannon as he investigates a serial killer. Morgan has led a film before, and in that film, called The Postcard Killings, Morgan also played a detective. Neponset Circle is based on actual events of an unsolved murder in the Boston area.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Played Judith Grimes On The Walking Dead? 8 Details About Cailey Fleming</a></span></p><h2 id=jeffrey-dean-morgan-stars-in-the-walking-dead-spinoff-dead-city><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jeffrey Dean Morgan Stars In The Walking Dead Spinoff, Dead City</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though Jeffrey Dean Morgan is excited to try new projects, the actor is not quite yet ready to say goodbye to The Walking Dead universe and his character Negan. It was announced prior to the end of The Walking Dead that a spinoff for characters Negan and Maggie titled The Walking Dead: Dead City was in the works. The show is set to start airing on AMC in April 2023.</p><p>The Walking Dead: Dead City is not the only spinoff The Walking Dead has created. Fear the Walking Dead began airing in 2015, initially showing the beginning of the zombie apocalypse in Los Angeles. The upcoming season will be she show’s last. Spinoff The Walking Dead: World Beyond had two seasons in 2020, and Tales of the Walking Dead is an anthology series which currently has just one season. Upcoming spinoffs include <a href=#>The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon</a> and an untitled project for characters Rick and Michonne.</p><h2 id=supernatural-reunion-through-the-boys><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Supernatural Reunion Through The Boys</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/The-Boys-Cast.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jeffrey Dean Morgan certainly has a lot of projects coming up, and that includes <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">joining the cast of Amazon Prime’s </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Boys</a>. The show is based off of a comic book series and tells the story of superheroes gone wrong. The superheroes featured in the satirical show are based off of popular Marvel and DC superheroes. The streaming network’s show is very popular and has received critical acclaim over its first three seasons.</p><p>Morgan’s addition to the show will be a bit of a reunion for Morgan. The Boys is created by Eric Kripke, the same creator for Supernatural, which Morgan was also a part of. Many Supernatural actors have joined The Boys, including Jensen Ackles and Jim Beaver. Beaver’s character name is the same in both Supernatural and The Boys in a nod to fans. Though Ackles has not confirmed that he will be in season 4, fans hope to see a reunion onscreen between Morgan and Ackles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYremssWrnLJllJqur3nMqKmgmZ5itrR5w6igp59dlrO1sdFmq6GdXayurbfIp55mnJWWsXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./unopened-super-mario-brothers-game-breaks-record-with-2-million-sale.html><span>←</span><span>Unopened Super Mario Brothers Game Breaks Record With $2 Million Sale</span></a>
