They share 3-year-old daughter Isabella Bunny, who was born in April 2020.</p><p class=p3>“It was very hard to have your first kid during the pandemic … mid-lockdown, no nannies, no grandparents helping out,” Jesse told <i>Us </i>on Thursday. “It takes a toll on a couple in that situation.”</p><p class=p1>Jesse and Michelle are friends of <strong>Jax Taylor</strong> and <strong>Brittany Cartwright</strong>, who also star on <i>The Valley</i>. The Bravo spinoff follows the <i>Vanderpump Rules </i>alums in their suburban life with 2-year-old son Cruz and their local community of friends. Throughout season 1, which debuts later this month, Jesse and Michelle’s marriage struggles will be apparent.</p><p class=p1>“There’s a major story line about our life where I try to work on myself throughout the entire summer to be the best version of myself,” Jesse teased to <i>Us</i>. “And if the best version of myself aligned with the best version of herself, then our marriage would make it. People evolve. If your marriage and relationship doesn’t evolve with it, it will never work no matter how bad you want it.”</p><p class=p1>Michelle, meanwhile, explained that they filmed <i>The Valley </i>“a while ago.”</p><p class=p1>“People said, ‘When you watch the show, you’re going to realize how you guys actually are,’ because when you’re in it, you don’t actually know,” she said in her own interview with <i>Us </i>on Thursday. “Taking a step back and looking at myself, I’m like, ‘Oh wow. It’s obvious we have some marital issues.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-Valley-Stars-Jesse-Lally-and-Michelle-Lally-Separate-After-Nearly-6-Years-of-Marriage.jpg><p class=p1>Michelle continued: “I want fans to know how real we were. We’re very authentic. We didn’t fake anything and we said if we’re going to do reality TV, we’re really going to open up our lives — the positive and the negative.”</p><p class=p1>Jesse and Michelle aren’t <a href=#>the only <i>Valley</i> couple</a> experiencing marital issues. Brittany, 35, confirmed in February that she moved out and was taking time apart from Jax.</p><p class=p1>“We’re separated. That is for sure. I want people to know that it is possible to coparent and run businesses and be OK with each other,” Jax, 44, <a href=#>told <i>Us</i> on Thursday</a>. “Not everybody just gets divorced because they cheated. Believe it or not, that was not the case. I know it’s shocking. We’re just not communicating right now and that’s all there is to it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Us Weekly&nbsp;has reached out for comment and they did not immediately respond.</p><p class=p1>The Valley premieres on Bravo Tuesday, March 19, following a new episode of Vanderpump Rules and will stream the next day on Peacock.
