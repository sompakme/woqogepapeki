It looks like the user you referenced is talking about our Approval Odds. We make clear on our site that these are your chances of approval, which does not mean approval is guaranteed. We determine Approval Odds by comparing a member’s credit profile to other Credit Karma members who were approved for this product, or whether the member meets certain criteria determined by the lender. There are a number of factors that determine whether someone gets approved for a financial product such as credit score, high credit utilization and accurate information on an application. As we say on our site, there’s no such thing as a sure thing, but Approval Odds may help you narrow down your choices. In fact, members shopping for credit cards on Credit Karma have over 50% higher approval rate than the national average [based on a comparison of Credit Karma member approval rates in calendar Q32022 vs the national approval rates for general purpose credit cards from 2020 according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s 2021 Consumer Credit Card Market Report (36%).”</i></p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><i><b>VIDEO: How a Matthews woman says she erased $45,000 in credit card debt</b></i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cmg-cmg-tv-10030-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/MJglaMxZ7hS32qOywGt7r0xD4hY=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/d1hfln2sfez66z.cloudfront.net/06-27-2023/t_fcba8233210046eaa6fb856a9272c473_name_PKG_NONPROFITS_HELP_WITH_DEBT_transfer_frame_4492.jpeg"><p class="ImageMetadata__MetadataParagraph-sc-1gn0vty-0 gAFIWJ image-metadata"><span class=title>‘I celebrated’: How a Matthews woman says she erased $45,000 in credit card debt</span></p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph body-copyright">©2023 Cox Media Group</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL%2FOnKuvZpOkunC6xLCqaKSfmK6te8yapWarka7Abq%2FRnpuirF2grrO5wGagrGWjqbatuIymoKyklZaxqrrGZpqopqOquqa%2B0mabnqugnsGmeZJmpKKknJ68r3nSnqutpJWisq%2FAjoeIbGt8fJqKf7V6eIOEeX6cl6anknyTfYqOfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mace-never-thought-it-was-possible-for-wwe-to-not-be-under-control-of-vince-mcmahon.html><span>←</span><span>Mace Never Thought It Was Possible For WWE To Not Be Under Control Of Vince Mcmahon</span></a>
