He decided to move away, far from other people, to forage and care for himself in the wild areas of Alaska when he turned 16. He made the decision to live off the grid for many years.</p><p>As an adult, his late teens and early 20s were spent in the wilderness, learning the way of the wild and how to survive in very extreme conditions.</p><p>As a result of this, there is not a lot of information available on his family – his parents and siblings or what his early childhood and teenage looked like.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-is-marty-raneys-net-worth></span><strong>How Much is Marty Raney’s Net Worth?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Marty Raney’s net worth is estimated to be around $1 million.

After their marriage, the couple relocated to the bear-populated area of Homestead in Haines, yet another wild area in the Alaskan wilderness with the added dangers of bears.</p><p>The couple lived there for 5 years before moving to the mountainous Wasilla area.

These families need to learn the necessary craft skills, hunting and foraging skills, as well as know how to avoid predators.</p><p>Marty Raney was on the show for 5 years, from 2016 up until 2021, and in those 5 years, he has managed to create a legacy for himself and his family with the Homestead rescue brand that still lives on.</p><p>The show has gone on to have a spinoff, Homestead Rescue: Raney Ranch, where the family returned to their home location in Alaska to replicate what they did on the original show.
