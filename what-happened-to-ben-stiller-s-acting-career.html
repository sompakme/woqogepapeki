Whether it's a performer <a href=#>from a sports drama</a>, an actress-turned model with multiple hits, or a former <a href=#>Disney Channel star</a>, careers in entertainment are wildly unpredictable beasts.</p><p>Ben Stiller has been in the game for decades at this point, and during the 2000s, he was one of the biggest comedic actors in Hollywood. Stiller was on a roll with his hit films, but over time, fans noticed that Stiller began disappearing from the big screen. Turns out, the man just changed positions in the industry.</p><p>Let's see what's taking Stiller's time these days, and whether he still has the desire to perform in front of the cameras anymore.</p><h2 id=ben-stiller-seemed-to-pivot-away-from-acting>Ben Stiller Seemed To Pivot Away From Acting</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar29722724.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like a chameleon donning new colors, Ben Stiller has adeptly navigated the currents of Hollywood. While his acting prowess catapulted him to stardom, recent years have witnessed a gradual but intentional pivot. Stiller, once synonymous with quirky characters and uproarious laughter, has chosen to embrace a different vantage point. The allure of the director's chair, with its canvas of creative control and visionary scope, has called to him.</p><p>Fans started the notice Stiller vanishing from the acting scene following some box office disappointments.

He hasn't simply rested on his laurels; instead, he's chosen to explore new avenues and experiment with his craft. As the curtain falls on his acting-heavy chapters, Stiller has focused his energy elsewhere, though the desire to act remains, as we will learn soon enough.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These days, instead of acting, Stiller is directing and producing.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened To Ben Stiller's Fake Son From Meet The Fockers, Ray Santiago</a></span></p><h2 id=ben-stiller-has-become-a-sensational-director>Ben Stiller Has Become A Sensational Director</h2><p>In a remarkable twist of fate, Ben Stiller's directorial journey has mirrored his acting ascendancy - marked by accolades, applause, and the uncanny ability to connect with audiences on an intimate level.

Each frame, each beat, meticulously woven together to craft narratives that are both thought-provoking and deeply entertaining.</p><p>On the small screen, Stiller is the man behind Severance, one of the biggest surprise hits in recent years. It showed the world an entirely different side of Ben Stiller's abilities.</p><p>After a masterclass in season one, Stiller dished on the story in season two.</p><p>"I think that the biggest thing is how to maintain all those things in terms of the feeling of the show, while at the same time expanding the world since the end of the last episode. We’ve brought Mark and Irving and Helly to the surface, and I think those are storylines that people are going to be interested in. So, it’s going to be figuring out that balance. We’re writing and prepping right now to shoot in October," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Cameron Diaz Feared A Scene With Ben Stiller In There's Something About Mary Would Ruin Her Career</a></span></p><h2 id=his-acting-legacy-is-still-intact-and-he-is-willing-to-act-again>His Acting Legacy Is Still Intact, And He Is Willing To Act Again</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/instar29789690.jpg><p>Yet, even as Ben Stiller assumes his role as a cinematic maestro, his legacy as an actor remains imprinted in the annals of Hollywood history. His characters, each more memorable than the last, have become threads in the rich tapestry of cinematic culture.</p><p>Who can forget the uproarious escapades of Greg Focker in Meet the Parents, or the zany allure of Derek Zoolander in the fashion-forward comedy Zoolander?

It hasn't been totally intentional except I really do enjoy directing and producing. I am getting to the point now where I am kind of missing acting a little bit and would like to figure out how to do something again. And I really decided recently, or probably about five years ago, that I didn't wanna do that anymore and just do one thing at a time. And lately I've been exploring projects [and] making things as a director and producer, and I’ve been very happy with that. But I really do look forward to acting again one of these days.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Christine Taylor Revealed That Her Husband Ben Stiller Was Initially A 'Rebound'</a></span></p><p>Ben Stiller's return to major acting will be a welcomed one from longtime fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bq7Ep2SsrJmhuaa%2B0maYnKyZo7Rur8CrnJ6qXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./randy-owen-net-worth-how-much-is-owen-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Randy Owen Net Worth How Much is Owen Worth?</span></a>
