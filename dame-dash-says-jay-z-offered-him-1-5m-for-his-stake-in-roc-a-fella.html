And I was like, ‘That’s some disrespectful sh*t. So, I guess I gotta sell it someplace else.’”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">After the New York entrepreneur attempted to sell his stake in Roc-A-Fella, the <a href=#>4:44</a> artist pursued litigation. The filmmaker then connected with an attorney, Ronald Sweeney, who suggested he explore all of his options. That is when he developed an interest in <a href=#>NFTs</a>, which presented him with the opportunity to make a lot more money than what he would’ve gained from Hov’s offer.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Dash also spoke on the challenges associated with the legal proceedings. “I got the lawsuit – ‘cause again, I got accused of doing something I didn’t to stop me from doing it, and then everybody just went missing. So I had to deal with the lawsuit on my own.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">They were eventually able to reach a settlement in June 2022, the latest chapter in their ongoing tension that has spanned decades.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Beyond the Roc-A-Fella fallout, Dame Dash has explored ventures such as cannabis and filmmaking. He recently released his 4/20-themed film <a href=#>Stoned</a>, which was shot in six days on <a href=#>Kanye West’s</a> Wyoming ranch in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. He plans to do sequels, explore a television series, and release a documentary that covers how the film came together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5murrGMnZisoF2frrrGjGpkbmWdnrmttc6nZKyskaCybr7OnJifnZyhrm59kWxrcGthan1zew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ana-ofelia-murgu%C3%ADa-hijos-son-pablo-and-daughter-marcela-marina-fern%C3%A1ndez.html><span>←</span><span>Ana Ofelia Murgua Hijos: Son Pablo And Daughter Marcela &amp;amp; Marina Fernndez</span></a>
