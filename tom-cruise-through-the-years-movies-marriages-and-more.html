After becoming interested in acting as a child, he landed his first onscreen role in 1981’s&nbsp;Endless Love.</p><p>Cruise went on to star in countless blockbusters and critically-acclaimed films, leading several franchises and earning more than one Academy Award nomination. Some of his notable work includes&nbsp;Mission: Impossible,&nbsp;Top Gun,&nbsp;Risky Business&nbsp;and&nbsp;Jerry Maguire.</p><p>The&nbsp;Rain Man&nbsp;star also became known for doing his own stunts in his action movies. “He’s <a href=#>too old for this stuff</a>,”&nbsp;Jack Reacher&nbsp;author <strong>Lee Child</strong> told&nbsp;The Times&nbsp;in November 2019. “He’s 57. He needs to move on, transition to being a character actor. He could get another 20 years out of it. He is talented. He’s a terrific guy, very considerate, good fun.”</p><p>While Cruise carried on with his career as planned, he had less success in his personal life. He was married to <strong>Mimi Rogers</strong> from 1987 to 1990, <a href=#><strong>Nicole Kidman</strong></a> from 1990 to 2001 and <a href=#><strong>Katie Holmes</strong></a> from 2006 to 2012.</p><p>The&nbsp;Cocktail&nbsp;star and Kidman <a href=#>adopted two children together</a>: daughter Isabella and son Connor. “I’m very private about that,” the actress told Australia’s&nbsp;Who&nbsp;magazine in November 2018. “I have to protect all those relationships. I know 150 percent that I would give up my life for my children because it’s what my purpose is.”</p><p>The Oscar winner added at the time:&nbsp;“They are adults. They are able to make their own decisions. They have made choices to be Scientologists and, as a mother, it’s my job to love them. And I am an example of that tolerance and that’s what I believe — that no matter what your child does, the child has love and the child has to know there is available love and I’m open here. I think that’s so important because if that is taken away from a child, to sever that in any child, in any relationship, in any family — I believe it’s wrong. So that’s our job as a parent, to always offer unconditional love.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;Cruise and Holmes welcomed a daughter in April 2006.</p><p>Scroll down to relive highlights from Cruise’s years in the spotlight.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwbC5jJyprqGjmnq1tNGorKCgXam1pnnYnpirq12ivLe1xKxkppmip7ais8SsZJqmlGK6sL7EaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./this-is-how-taylor-swift-reacted-to-harry-styles-being-heckled-by-beyonc%C3%A9-fans-during-his-grammy-ac.html><span>←</span><span>This Is How Taylor Swift Reacted To Harry Styles Being Heckled By Beyonc Fans During His Grammy Ac</span></a>
