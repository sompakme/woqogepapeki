During an interview with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>, the former Los Angeles Laker opened up about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">becoming healthier.</a>&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He stated he is down to 351 pounds as he attempts to regain his “championship caliber” shape. O’Neal explained that he became “Charles Barkley fat” after joining&nbsp;TNT’s Inside the <a href=# id=auto-tag_nba data-tag=nba>NBA</a>.&nbsp;He then stated that he sets “crazy goals” for himself, but he’s nearing his desired weight.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I was getting chubby and couldn’t even walk up the stairs. I didn’t like the way I looked in the mirror,” he admits. “I was like, ‘I’m gonna lose 20’ and then I was trying — I’m probably gonna get between 315 and 330.” The famed basketball big man also shared that he has “a little 4.9 pack.” However, Shaq’s goal is to build himself “an eight-pack.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">This isn’t the first time Shaq publicized his&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>health journey</a>. O’Neal, 51, previously spoke with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Entertainment Tonight&nbsp;</a>in December 2022 about a massive weight loss. At the time, Shaq explained that he lost 40 pounds.&nbsp;“I lost 40 pounds,” the ex-All-Star expressed. “I need to lose about 20 more, but impressive. Imma get real chiseled up and do an underwear ad with my sons.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He also stated that, based on his results from previous blood work, he would need to clean up his diet and get healthier now that he’s retired from basketball. “The weight just fell off. I’m not at 100 percent ninja mode yet. I’m still 75 percent. I think I could get the Marky Wahlberg look. I want to be known as the Black Mark Wahlberg.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Earlier this year, the former LSU athlete posted a picture of his body post-<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>surgery</a>. According to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>TMZ</a>, the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>former acclaimed center</a>&nbsp;went under the knife for hip surgery after needing to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“fix a nagging injury.”</a>&nbsp;“To all the people who are concerned,” he typed on his Instagram post. “First let me start off by saying thank you. And lastly, I am fine. Just had to get some BBL work done aka&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>#hipreplacement</a>. But yes, I am fine no need to worry.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6i1or3UoqOlnV2ku6aty2ZsbqSSqHqpscClq6Flk6S7tK%2FIqKysZaSnrq%2B%2FxaipppmknryveZBram1vaGuBdn6O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rick-ross-sister-tawanda-roberts-talks-about-working-with-the-bawse.html><span>←</span><span>Rick Ross Sister Tawanda Roberts Talks About Working With The Bawse</span></a>
