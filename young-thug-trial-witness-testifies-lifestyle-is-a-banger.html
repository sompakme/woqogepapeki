In the back-and-forth, he reveals his connection to Thugger is limited to fandom.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Personally? No,” Singleton explained when asked if he knew Young Thug. “Wait, hold on. Can I go back?…&nbsp;I didn’t know Jeffrey Williams by that name.

According to <a href=#>Billboard,</a> the trial which began six months ago projected to end near the end of this year, the proceedings are already the longest in Georgia’s history.

I’ve been involved in significant civil cases, for example, involving up to a dozen or more [corporate] defendants,” Weinstein detailed to the outlet. “I’ve never seen any case like [this]. I’ve never seen any case drag out for this expected length of time.” The defense attorney said he believes the state’s witness testimony has become “duplicative” and “unnecessary.” He estimates the state’s case is “going to drag well into 2025.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Throughout the ordeal, the “Digits” performer has <a href=#>received support</a> from his current romantic partner <a href=#>Mariah The Scientist</a>, <a href=#>Drake</a>, Quavo, Chance The Rapper, Killer Mike,&nbsp;and more.
