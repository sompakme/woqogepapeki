The <a href=#>suave crooner </a>and lead singer of <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234744613>The Gap Band </a>sat with the <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234668681>EGOT winner </a>during his appearance on Monday (Jan. 29) to discuss the group’s origin and meeting the likes of Stevie Wonder and Donny Hathaway during those early days.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">When asked who came up with the name for the group, Wilson quipped that it was a collective effort of sorts. “We were called The Greenwood, Archer, and Pine Street band and we tried to put it on a poster,” he reflected. Ultimately, they abbreviated the name, but an error lead to the poster reading “GAP” instead of “G.A.P.” Wilson noted in a smooth tone, “And I added the ‘band’ to it.” That was that.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The band of brothers were preacher’s kids and weren’t allowed to listen to secular music at home. However, Wilson admittedly snuck away to listen to the “blues,” which for him meant <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234736063>Sam Cooke</a>, <a href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1234662418>Stevie Wonder, </a><a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234636908>Sly and the Family Stone</a>, and <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234660514>Donny Hathaway.</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Later in the segment, Hudson presented Wilson with the <a href=#>Legend Award</a> before serenading him with a birthday song. He joked that he’d been “waiting a long time” to get on her stage and mentioned that he hopes she’ll have 25 seasons of The Jennifer Hudson Show.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The “<a href=#>Outstanding</a>” singer also spoke on his star on the<a href=#> Hollywood Walk of Fame</a>. His manager, Michael Paran, surprised him with the announcement and he “fell to his knees, tears were just running.” Wilson recalled once being a homeless addict on the very street where his star now resides. However, thanks to his wife and God, he’s grateful for nearly 30 years of sobriety.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5i1or7Lopxmr5mhwLC6jK2fnmWXlr1ursCnm2anop60qrqMrZ%2BeZZqau6%2B1xZ6pZqClmcCwuoysn6ivXWZ%2FdICXbWxycGVk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amy-robach-t-j-holmes-hold-hands-in-mexico-after-gma3-exit.html><span>←</span><span>Amy Robach, T.J.
