Yet unlike most rap posts, this wasn’t concert cash that will eventually become expensive accessories. Rather, these stacks came from a fundraiser and were being prepped for donation.</p><p>A day prior to the posts, the DMV-native hosted a “Stop The Violence” show featuring several local acts. The event was a major success. According to Mike D’Angelo’s Instagram, the show generated a “significant” amount of cash (enough to “buy a car”), all of which he gave to the families of deceased DMV youth, including the mother of James Anthony Smith, the Southeast teen killed for his sneakers.</p><p>The 17-year-old Smith, who his mother described to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Washington Post</a> as “an All-American kid,” was murdered Dec. 18&nbsp; for his Air <a href=# id=auto-tag_jordans_1 data-tag=jordans>Jordans</a>, making him one of D.C.’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">113 murders</a> (the sixth under 18).
