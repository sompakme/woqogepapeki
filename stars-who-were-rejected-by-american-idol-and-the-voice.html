During a March 2019 appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, a caller asked the Texas native how she felt about not making it on <a href=#>American Idol </a>and <a href=#>The Voice</a>. Morris replied: “That’s not even it. I was rejected from, like, <a href=#>America’s Got Talent</a> [too]. There were a ton that I didn’t make it to.”</p><p>Despite her <a href=#>reality TV setbacks</a>, the “Middle” singer is happy with the way things turned out.</p><p>“People cover my songs for their auditions on those shows [now], so it’s like, not only is it really nice to have my song on a national television show — but [I also] get to collect the check and have some sweet revenge,” she joked.</p><p>Combs, for his part, recalled <a href=#>going through several rounds of auditions</a> for The Voice producers during a June 2022 appearance on the “Full Send” podcast.</p><p>“I tell them I want to do a country song, and they are like, <a href=#>‘Oh, well, you didn’t sing country before.’</a> I’m like, ‘So, I have to sing one kind of [music]? The show is just about being a singer.’ There’s got to be some sort of angle,” the “Going, Going, Gone” crooner explained.</p><p>He continued: “I got a letter back after the next audition — which, I made it through — and they told me, essentially,<a href=#> I was too boring to be on television</a>. … I didn’t make it to the show. I still have the letter in storage that’s like, ‘You’re a great singer, but … .’ Essentially, it’s about ratings, right?”</p><p>While Combs’ rebuff wasn’t necessarily about talent, Kelly’s voice was deemed “almost annoying” by judge <a href=#><strong>Simon Cowell</strong></a> during her 2010 audition for American Idol. The “Unbreakable Smile” artist received positive <a href=#>feedback from the other judges</a> and progressed to Hollywood week but failed to earn a spot in the top 24.</p><p>The California native talked about the experience during a September 2019 appearance on <a href=#>The Kelly Clarkson Show</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I don’t regret anything and <a href=#>I think Simon is cool</a>,” she said. “No hard feelings. I actually should thank him because it all happened for a reason.”</p><p>Scroll down to see all the stars who’ve been rejected by American Idol and The Voice:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BowaK%2B0mauoaddrLKzsYyrnKOdk6mypXnBsmSapZWntqStzWagnaecYq6vsIytn55lpqS2pLGO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sky-bri-net-worth-how-much-is-sky-bri-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Sky Bri Net Worth How Much is Sky Bri Worth?</span></a>
