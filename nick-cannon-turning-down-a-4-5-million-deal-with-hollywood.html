Some might know him as Mariah Carey's ex-husband, others as the host of America's Got Talent, others still as an astonishing musician. No matter how you’ve learned of him, one thing’s for sure – he became a household name in show business.</p><p>In August 2022, The news of Brittany’s pregnancy comes as a surprise to many, as Nick already has another baby on the way. In June, Abby De La Rosa announced she’s pregnant again. The DJ already shares a set of twins, sons Zillion and Zion, with Nick, so it’s largely speculated that her third child is also his.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nick and Abby’s twins were born last year, only a month before The Masked Singer host welcomed his seventh child with Alyssa Scott. However, the couple’s infant son, Zen, passed away from brain cancer shortly after his birth.</p><p>As reported by <a href=#><i>The Things</i></a>, Nick Cannon ended up leaving America's Got Talent, in large part, for a situation that stems from his stand-up act on Showtime. According to Cannon himself, the network was none too pleased with his act and the message he was sending. Based on what Cannon stated, NBC didn't like that the performance wasn't 'PG', typically to how he is as a host on America's Got Talent.</p><p>Cannon revealed that it wasn't the first time he had encountered such problems with the network. Though this time around, he wasn't going to be threatened for it.</p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED: </b><a href=#><b>Nick Cannon Just Bought His Pregnant Baby Mama A House</b></a></span></p><p>Cannon stated alongside USA Today, "I was to be punished for a joke ... My soul won't allow me to be in business with corporations that attempt to frown on freedom of speech, censor artists, and question cultural choices."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cannon further revealed it wasn't the first time he was getting punished by the network, "Not to get too detailed but this isn't the first time executives have attempted to 'put me in my place' for so-called unruly actions."</p><p>Cannon had enough, and he left the show because of it, sending Hollywood a message.</p><p>It was supposed to be Cannon's eighth season on the show, however, he had enough. Cannon wrote on Facebook at the time, "I will not stand for it. My moral principles will easily walk away from the millions of dollars they hang over my head."</p><p>Not only did Cannon leave a series viewed by millions per week, but he also left serious money on the table. The host was reportedly making in the ballpark of $4.5 million per season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#><i>TMZ</i></a> reported that NBC considered firing Cannon over his jokes in the special, but that they decided to let the comments slide. However, Cannon came to the conclusion that he didn't want to work in an environment where he felt his freedom of speech was going to be impaired -- particularly when it came to speaking out about issues regarding race.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT: </b><a href=#><b>Timberwolves' ‘Ant-Man’ Anthony Edwards Fined $40K For Being Homophobic In IG Video Story</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TheThings</a>, <a href=#>The Shade Room</a>, <a href=#>TMZ</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS7qq%2FKZpqapp6ku27A1KuloqaXYrGww81mmGZsXWp6rrXLpaCopl2ZsqK4jLCgraBdnbytuNiwpqicXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lil-wayne-arrives-to-festival-late-performs-for-15-minutes.html><span>←</span><span>Lil Wayne Arrives To Festival Late, Performs For 15 Minutes</span></a>
