The four clinked their champagne flutes as they appeared to enjoy dinner at a restaurant.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Stormi – who was first connected to Joe at the start of the new year when they traveled to Mexico together – wasn’t tagged in the post.

Post a picture together already! Give the people what they want!!” another person said, encouraging Joe and Stormi to go Instagram-official, like Sophie recently did with her new romantic interest.</p><p>Joe and Sophie met in 2016 and had a whirlwind relationship before announcing their engagement in October 2017. The couple then surprised fans by tying the knot in a private ceremony in Las Vegas in May 2019, followed by a more formal wedding celebration in France in June of the same year. In July 2020, Joe and Sophie welcomed their first child, a daughter named Willa, followed by a second daughter, Delphine, in 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqqKiYnrJuwNSrpZ6qXZu5osHNrapmppWseqO72J%2Bpop2emXqistOeqWaoop7GorrKmmScoJ%2Blv6K%2FjKyjsmWUnsC0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hannah-brown-i-m-not-in-rush-to-get-engaged-to-adam-woolard.html><span>←</span><span>Hannah Brown: I'm 'Not in Rush' to Get Engaged to Adam Woolard</span></a>
