The blue brand offered a fine blend of entertainment and in-ring action. It also witnessed the rise of future main eventers under Triple H’s watchful eye.</p><p>Stars such as Dragon Lee and Carmelo Hayes made an impact with their spectacular performances on back-to-back Friday nights. There’s no denying that the future is bright for these two thrilling superstars.</p><p>That being said, let’s take a look at some of the best WWE SmackDown matches of 2023:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Drew McIntyre & Sheamus vs. Viking Raiders (WWE SmackDown – February 17)</h2><p>Drew McIntyre and Sheamus found themselves in a brief yet heated feud with Viking Raiders two months before WrestleMania 39. McIntyre and Sheamus joined forces to take on Erik and Ivar in a tag team match on the February 17 episode of WWE SmackDown.</p><p>All four competitors delivered an extremely physical match-up. The two teams used their strength and agility to give this match a more realistic feel. In the end, McIntyre and Sheamus secured the win over the Raiders.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Dragon Lee vs. Butch (NXT North American Title Match – December 22)</h2><p>Dragon Lee emerged as one of the fastest-rising stars on the WWE roster in 2022. The second-generation superstar was dubbed as the “Future of Lucha Libre” by Rey Mysterio.</p><p>Lee made his mark on SmackDown with a series of incredible matches against Cedric Alexander. He also had an exceptional showing against Axiom. But his best match (arguably) on the blue brand came against Butch for the NXT North American Championship.</p><p>Both men delivered extremely fast-paced action from bell to bell. The match featured plenty of nearfalls and some spectacular counters. Lee countered Butch’s Bitter End into a Destroyer, followed by the Operation Dragon for the win.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Edge vs. Sheamus (WWE SmackDown – August 18)</h2><p>Edge had a series of solid matches in 2023. He capped off his feud with The Judgment Day by winning his Hell in a Cell encounter with Finn Balor at WrestleMania 39. He, however, was unable to secure a spot in the advanced stages of the World Heavyweight title tournament.</p><p>The WWE Hall of Famer wrestled his farewell match in the company against Sheamus on a packed SmackDown in Toronto. The Celtic Warrior gave his close friend a near-perfect sendoff with fantastic in-ring storytelling. Both men embraced after the extremely physical match-up.</p><p>Edge would end up in AEW under his real name, Adam Copeland. He recently had a fantastic match against childhood best friend, Christian Cage, at AEW <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Worlds End</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Rey Mysterio vs. Santos Escobar (United States Championship Match – September 29)</h2><p>Rey Mysterio upset Austin Theory to win the United States Championship on the August 11, 2023, episode of WWE SmackDown. The Hall of Famer put his title on the line against protégé Santos Escobar on the final SmackDown of September.</p><p>This match contained plenty of greatly-executed spots. Escobar looked great as the pupil on the rise against his illustrious mentor. Rey managed to narrowly secure the win after a great match. He would be betrayed by the Legado leader just a few months later.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-asuka-vs-iyo-sky-wwe-women-s-championship-match-september-22>Asuka vs. Iyo Sky (WWE Women’s Championship Match – September 22)</h2><p>Iyo Sky realized her dream of winning a world title in 2023. The Genius of the Sky cashed in her Money in the Bank contract at SummerSlam. She pinned Bianca Belair with a picture-perfect moonsault to win her first WWE Women’s Championship.</p><p>Sky put her title on the line against longtime rival Asuka in a 20-minute classic on the September 22 episode of WWE SmackDown. This was a perfect display of athleticism and hard-hitting offense from the former Joshi stars.</p><p>A distraction from Bayley allowed Iyo to retain her title with a moonsault. The two stars would cross paths in the lead-up to Survivor Series: WarGames. This time, however, the Empress of Tomorrow would <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">align herself</a> with Damage CTRL.</p><h2>Honorable Mentions</h2><ul><li>Dragon Lee vs. Axiom (November 17)</li><li>Iyo Sky vs. Charlotte Flair (WWE SmackDown – October 20)</li><li>Kevin Owens vs. Austin Theory (December 15)</li><li>Gunther vs. Braun Strowman (WWE SmackDown – January 13)</li><li>WWE United States Title&nbsp;Invitational Fatal Four Way Match (July 21)</li></ul><p>: <a href=#>5 Best SmackDown Moments Of 2023</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaJ6VlsG2vsSsZpudo6l6uL7ErKuloZ6cfHKAkmtwaWpdl7K0wIywrp5lo6KupLfDqK6nZZ2WwaS0xKxkqJ5dZ31zfw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alex-grinch-wife-becky-blaser-grinch-was-a-three-sports-athlete-at-mount-union-university.html><span>←</span><span>Alex Grinch Wife Becky Blaser Grinch Was A Three Sports Athlete At Mount Union University</span></a>
