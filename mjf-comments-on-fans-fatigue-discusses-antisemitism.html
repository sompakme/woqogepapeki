He is set to headline AEW Worlds End, where Samoa Joe will challenge him for the gold.</p><p><a href=#>MJF</a> recently wrote an article for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Players’ Tribune</a>. He highlighted how he is tired and injured, and he also admitted that he knows some fans are tired of him.</p><p>“I’m tired,” MJF wrote. “I know that’s not what you’re supposed to say as a professional wrestler — especially not before a big world title defense in your hometown. I know I should take my vitamins, brother, order up an expensive coffee to the five-star hotel room I’m staying in (thanks, Tony), and end this article by cutting an ’80s good guy promo about the evil Samoa Joe.</p><p>“Let’s sell some Pay-Per-Views!!!!!!! But I don’t know, man. I’m just so, so, so tired. That’s the God’s honest truth. My hip is a mess. My arm won’t lift above my head. I’m on painkillers, which are not my thing. I can’t sleep. But like I said earlier…… I know it’s not only me who’s tired. I know our fans are a little tired of this run I’ve been on. And for the first time since this company started, I know there’s some MJF fatigue. Which is fine, by the way — no one stays hot forever.”</p><h2 id=h-mjf-on-antisemitism>MJF On Antisemitism</h2><p>After noting that he doesn’t know what comes next, MJF shifted gears and delivered a passionate message about his real-life experiences about getting bullied for being Jewish.</p><p>“Here’s what I do know. Wrestling in the main event of a card at&nbsp;Nassau Coliseum&nbsp;as&nbsp;AEW world champ?&nbsp;That sh*t means&nbsp;everything&nbsp;to me,” MJF wrote. “Really. EVERYTHING. People are always telling me how Long Island is a part of my “character” — nope, f*ck you, it’s home. I’m a short kid with learning disabilities from Long Island. Not a character. People are always telling me how getting bullied is a part of my “backstory” — nope, f*ck you, it happened. Kids threw quarters at me and told me to “pick it up, Jew Boy.” Not a backstory. And if you think this is that ’80s good guy promo I was teasing a couple of paragraphs ago, it isn’t.</p><p>“Actually … you want to know the truth? Sometimes I wonder if standing up to antisemitism would even be a “babyface move” anymore. No, for real — I legit wonder. I wonder if being a proud Jew like I am, in 2023, has actually made me LESS popular as a wrestler. And if deep down, when someone says they have “MJF fatigue,” what they really mean is “enough with the Jewish stuff already.” I honestly don’t know the answer to that … and I’m sure I’ll get sh*t for even asking the question. But that’s where my thoughts are right now. It’s “fear the worst.” I’m a Jew in America and I’m f*cking soul sick.”</p><h2 id=h-mjf-we-all-deserve-rights-freedom-and-happiness>MJF: We All Deserve Rights, Freedom, And Happiness</h2><p>MJF continued by making it clear that he does not support war or people dying because of hate. He stated that people calling for the death of Jews makes him sick. He wrote that we are all human, and we all deserve freedom, happiness and respect.</p><p>“Allow me to say this, straight up, point blank: I don’t support terrorism, Zionism, genocide, war, bombs, genocidal governments, dead innocent Palestinians, dead innocent Israelis,” MJF wrote. “I don’t support people —&nbsp;any people&nbsp;— dying because of hate. I’ll tell you what I do support, and what I definitely am: I’m anti-hate. I’m sick to my stomach that people are calling for the death of Jews over something that’s happening on the other side of the world.</p><p>“And I’m sick that Hamas, a literal terrorist organization, has fans on&nbsp;this&nbsp;side of the world — as on a daily basis I’m having to read antisemitic sh*t from all kinds of people: celebrities (hi, Kanye), strangers, even people I know. It’s just very sad. We’re all human, man. We all deserve rights, we all deserve freedom, we all deserve happiness and respect. (I really wanted to clarify these things and I hope I have. These are the serious conversations I have with the very hot woman I’m in love with, who by the way is Palestinian.)”</p><p>MJF ended the article with a final message about his “Jewishness”, and he hyped up AEW Wordls End by vowing to tear the house down or die trying. He went on to wish AEW a happy birthday, and he thanked those who have helped the company succeed.</p><p>“Here’s the last thing I’ll say about my Jewishness: If you’re over it, tough sh*t,” MJF wrote. “If you feel like it’s a political statement, I can’t help you. If it makes you uncomfortable, good I’m glad. If you think I should tone it down, no I won’t. If you hate me for other reasons, yeah that’s fair.</p><p>Here’s the last thing I’ll say about Worlds End — and don’t worry it’s toxic: I will tear the f*cking house down against Joe or I will LITERALLY DIE TRYING. Do not celebrate that sentence, it’s so stupid. If I was being smart I’d sit this one out. I’m not being smart. I only get one first title reign, and one first title defense in my hometown. I won’t tell you my entire career has been building to this because my entire life has been building to this.</p><p>And then finally…. here’s the last thing I’ll say about AEW: Happy birthday,&nbsp;you f*cking weirdo. To everyone who’s helped us succeed, THANKS. And to everyone who hoped we would fail — Yikes!!!!! Sorry for your loss, my condolences truly. Order the PPV though it will be sick.”</p><p>WrestleZone will have full coverage of AEW Worlds End as it airs on Saturday, December 30.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNsaW5oYWK6q7KMnKampZWjwbR5zqdkn5meqHqnrdOinq6dXZm2tK%2FUrKqeq12Wu7W10p6koqyZqLo%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jodie-sweetin-news-us-weekly.html><span>←</span><span>Jodie Sweetin News - Us Weekly</span></a>
