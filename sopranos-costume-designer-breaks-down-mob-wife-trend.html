According to Polcsa, the social media aesthetic “has a life of its own.” (The Sopranos aired from 1999 until 2007.)</p><p>In January, <strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong> shared <a href=#>her take on the fad</a>, dressing in a Gucci bikini, fur coat and fluffy hat while posing in the snow on a trip to Aspen. Kardashian teamed her ensemble with knee-high snow boots. For glam she rocked pink lined lips, a soft contour and wispy eyelashes, created by her makeup artist, <strong>Ash K. Holm</strong>. Her blonde hair cascaded to her waist and she styled it in a bouncy blowout.</p><p>“It’s giving mob wife vibes,” she captioned the post. “Faux mob wife of course.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6i8sb7Ap6asZZOkwLXBzJ5knZ2jnrSvsdFmmaudkaDAbrDOsKVmpZ%2BXeri1xZ5kraqVo7Fw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./larry-elder-height-net-worth-how-much-is-larry-elder-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Larry Elder Height Net Worth How Much is Larry Elder Worth?</span></a>
