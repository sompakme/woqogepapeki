A team of 20 artists spent four months and more than 500 hours creating the wax figure.</p><p>The lifelike creation is not the first inspired by the songstress’ 2018 Coachella appearance. A similar figure was added to Madame Tussauds’ London location earlier this year.</p><p>Beyoncé performed a slew of her most popular hits over the course of two weekends at the festival. She also brought out special guests, including husband <a href=#><strong>Jay-Z</strong></a>, sister <a href=#><strong>Solange</strong></a> and her fellow Destiny’s Child members, <a href=#><strong>Kelly Rowland</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Michelle Williams</strong></a>.</p><p>The “Formation” singer documented the <a href=#>behind-the-scenes prep work in her Netflix special,&nbsp;Homecoming,</a> which was released in April. As revealed in the film, Beyoncé rehearsed for eight months to curate the flawless production. “When I decided to do Coachella, instead of me pulling out my flower crown, it was more important that I brought our culture,” she explained of the inspiration for her performance.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In a voiceover, she noted her involvement in every aspect: “I personally selected each dancer, every light, material on the steps, the height of the pyramid, the shape of the pyramid, every patch was hand-sewn, every tiny detail had an intention.”</p><p>Homecoming&nbsp;gave fans a peek at Beyonce’s pregnancy with twins Rumi and Sir, 2. She postponed Beychella for a year due to her expectant state. She and Jay-Z, 49, also share 7-year-old daughter Blue Ivy.</p><p>An insider revealed in June that the couple, who tied the knot in April 2008, value time with their family of five. “Jay-Z and Beyoncé have nannies for the kids and their assistants help out too, but they mostly try and bring the kids everywhere,” the source told&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;exclusively. “Blue always travels with Beyoncé and comes with her when she’s working. The twins are getting older and Beyoncé has been taking them out a little more too. … They’re a very tight-knit family and <a href=#>like to do everything together</a>.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabnamku6Sx0maaqJmTnbKtuMBmrpqwXZu2qMHRnmSiq12ovG6%2Fz6irZqeeZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-most-influential-voice-actors.html><span>←</span><span>10 Most Influential Voice Actors</span></a>
