A good pair of eyeglasses is an underrated outfit maker. Even if we don’t need them to enhance our vision, we’re no strangers to grabbing a pair to enhance our outfit. Glasses can make an entire look, so we should love ours and the way they make us feel when we’re wearing them."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

We receive compensation when you click on a link and make a purchase. <a href=# rel>Learn more!</a></p><p>A good pair of eyeglasses is an underrated outfit maker. Even if we don’t need them to enhance our vision, we’re no strangers to grabbing a pair to enhance our outfit. Glasses can make an entire look, so we should love ours and the way they make us feel when we’re wearing them.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joanna eyeglasses from Kendall + Kylie Eyewear</a> are a statement piece. <strong>Kendall</strong> and <strong>Kylie Jenner</strong> realize the importance of glasses as style accessories, and with their #FrameLove campaign, they want everyone to embrace their “own unique style.” The sisters’ eyewear line “reflects the duality of their distinct fashion perspectives,” and in these Joanna glasses specifically, we can see a clear mix of their iconic styles.</p><p><strong>Check all of the Kendall + Kylie Eyewear line <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>!</strong></p><p>The Joanna’s frames have a wiry look to them, but instead of the oversized frames having clean lines or forming a perfect circle or oval, they play with shape for a totally uncommon result that’s a show-stopping blend of vintage and modern. Coming out from the bridge, the rims begin to form a sleek circle, but are fashionably interrupted by sharp angles as they begin to reach the outer corners of our face.</p><p><strong>See it: Check out the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kendall + Kylie eyeglasses</a> starting at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$135</a> at AC Lens! Get $5 off orders of $50 or more with code ACLS5 at AC Lens – Limited time only (selling out fast)!</strong></p><p>In the top photo, we can see how this unique shape gorgeously traces Kylie Jenner’s features. The top of the frames influences a perfect arch in our eyebrows, while the inside works to contour our nose even when we’re too lazy (or late) to do our makeup! The outer corners even hint at a cat-eye effect. This striking silhouette is made for a bare face, but when we are all made up, the frames are wide enough to make sure no details are hidden or blocked!</p><p>Past the rims and lenses, the temples continue with the silver color, only changing once they reach the tips, where they smoothly fade in and out of a golden bronze. This is the kind of edgy elegance we’ve been looking for!</p><p>These lightweight Joanna glasses also feature adjustable nose pads so they’ll have a perfectly snug fit on anyone who wears them. That’s just the beginning of their amazing features. Whether our lenses are prescription or not, they are scratch-resistant, so when we inevitably drop them, we won’t need to worry about scratches permanently obstructing our vision until we finally decide to invest in a replacement.</p><p>The fashion lenses are also UV-protective, so we won’t necessarily need to switch to sunglasses every time the sun peeps out from the clouds. Along with this, the lenses are anti-reflective, which means they will reduce eye strain and give everyone a clear look into our eyes . . . if we allow them the chance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Lauren-Sheriff-Joanna-Glasses.jpg><p><strong>See it: Check out the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kendall + Kylie Joanna eyeglasses</a> starting at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$135</a> at AC Lens!

We can either get single vision lenses for every day, or progressive bifocal lenses for reading. Then we can pick a specific lens package, with options for a gray or brown tint, UV protection, thinner lenses and even transition lenses. The transition lenses are light-adaptive, so they’ll darken to protect our eyes when we’re exposed to UV light.</p><p>As a little bonus touch, these Joanna glasses also have a small Kendall and Kylie logo on the temple! That will match well with the branded case that’s included with our purchase of these eyeglasses. We may want to wear them all the time, but we should probably stick them back in the case while we’re sleeping or skydiving. Whatever kind of activity floats our boat.</p><p>These conversation-starting glasses would look so cute with any outfit, regardless of if we’re going for a casual look or a professional one. When we’re wearing these, it’s like we’re living the Jenner sisters’ luxurious lifestyle, feeling like style icons wherever we go.</p><p>Orders of $99 or more from AC Lens means shipping adds up to . . . nothing!
