On the latest installment of Tax Stone’s Tax Season podcast, guest Karen Civil shares a rather interesting story of how Cam and the rest of the Dipset gang were kicked out of Def Jam over a parking spot. The crew got the boots from no other than Jay Z himself.</p><p>“<a href=# rel=nofollow>Jay Z</a> was pulling up in his Maybach, right? You know how Def Jam was on the side of the Universal building at the time? So Cam was in this turtle top like parked right there and he was talking to Duke, we were near the car,” she remembers. “And then this Maybach wants to pull up and they honk. I’m like ‘Oh I think that’s Hov’ so I back up. Cam’s like ‘Chill out.’ So then the car beeps again. And Cam ain’t move. So then Jay had to get out the car and he walked over cause he wanted to see who was in the car, like who wouldn’t move out the way.&nbsp;So then he came over, he looked… Dipset was out of the building the next week. And so we&nbsp;set up shop in Juelz’s studio for a little bit…I’ll never forget this. ”</p><p>While Jay made it a point to have them removed from the premises for good, Civil says he was never rude about it. Like a silent killer, he just took note and then proceeded. ““He dapped everyone, he nodded, he made a mental note,” she said. “Then they said, I think it was HR or whatever, is like, ‘Hey guys I’m gonna need you to wrap this up cause technically you guys aren’t here.’ It was such a crazy experience, but Cam is Cam, he don’t care. He’s still the same now on his Instagram. You gotta love him for who he is. He doesn’t switch up.”</p><p>Interestingly enough, this&nbsp;anecdote gives us some insight on Jay and Cam’s&nbsp;tumultuous relationship. Killa Cam is definitely a stubborn one though.
