The two Leto boys took their stepfather's name, and they grew up with their mom and maternal grandparents.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And while Shannon Leto and Jared Leto also have two half-brothers, from their dad's second marriage, it's the two Leto boys who have really been in the spotlight.</p><p>Of course, Jared has been arguably more so, but Shannon has his own talent to fall back on.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What Jared Leto's Costars Have Said About Working With Him</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans think that Jared Leto and Scott Disick have something in common</a>, and it has to do with more than just their dating histories. But in fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">if Jared nixed his famous beard</a>, he'd look a lot more like his brother Shannon than any other Hollywood celeb.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The brothers, who are only about three years apart in age, do resemble one another, but Shannon is a bit more rocker than "hippie," if critiques of Leto's latest Joker rendition are any indication.</p><p>Shannon, for his part, is billed as a musician first and foremost, as he's part of the band Thirty Seconds to Mars with his little brother and has been since 1988. But it's not just drums and rock shows (and millions of albums sold) for Shannon.</p><p>He also has an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a> resume, although it&nbsp;is a bit short compared to Jared's. Shannon's IMDb page lists two appearances on 'My So-Called Life,' which is a series his little bro was on. He was an extra in two other films as well, but never quite caught the acting bug the way the younger Leto has.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That's not to say he's just riding on Jared's coattails though. Shannon's Wikipedia page also describes him as a businessman, and one of his ventures combined his love of a fast-paced lifestyle with the fuel that kept him going; coffee.</p><p>Shannon launched a company to sell specialty, fair-trade coffee beans, and it seemed to do well for at least a few years. But recently, the website shut down, liquidating the Black Fuel Trading Co inventory and promising to try and return later.</p><p>Fortunately, Shannon's other ventures are still going strong -- including merch for Thirty Seconds to Mars -- online. Fans can find lyric-inscribed sweatshirts, lyric tees, bracelets, notebooks, and more on the band's website.</p><p>While some of the merch is pricey ($155 for a sweatshirt, for one thing), the brothers Leto are keeping most items accessible for fans, to the point where they sell out. Though some fans of Jared Leto may not have realized how hip his brother is, Shannon's got enough of a following to ensure success in whatever business venture he decides to go with next.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's How Margot Robbie Handled Jared Leto's Rat Prank On The Set Of 'Suicide Squad'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsButsCrnJ1lnJrBsHnBq6atoJWnerS0wKelqKZf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-undertaker-s-1-deadman-show-announced-for-royal-rumble-2024-weekend.html><span>←</span><span>The Undertakers 1 deadMAN SHOW Announced For Royal Rumble 2024 Weekend</span></a>
