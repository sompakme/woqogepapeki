The quirky concept of preteens striking gold with a hit vlog is a very common story kids know these days. For older individuals who watched the show when it aired on <a href=#>Nickelodeon</a> between 2007 and 2012, re-watching episodes of iCarly is like a pleasant blast from the past.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Perez Hilton Is Freaking Out Over iCarly Reboot In Spite Of Show’s Dark History</a></span></p><p class=p1>It’s nice being able to reflect on all the old episodes of a great show in preparation for its revival! <a href=#>The reboot of iCarly</a> has officially been announced and will star <a href=#>Miranda Cosgrove</a>, Nathan Kress, and Jerry trainer in the leading roles. Here’s what the cast thinks of the original show.</p><h2 id=miranda-cosgrove-on-her-friendship-with-jennette-mccurdy><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Miranda Cosgrove On Her Friendship With&nbsp;Jennette McCurdy</span></h2><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AOL</a>, Miranda Cosgrove was really close to her onscreen BFF in real life too. When asked about it she said, “My best friend is Jennette McCurdy, who was on iCarly with me. We live really close to each other. We have sleepovers all the time. Like, I literally see her every other day.” In the show, they play the characters of BFFs who perfectly balance each other out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennette-mccurdy-on-the-show-s-playlist><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Jennette McCurdy On The Show's Playlist</span></h2><p>The music used in iCarly stood out to <a href=#>Jennette McCurdy</a> quite a bit. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She revealed</a>, "I think the iCarly soundtrack II is a great party playlist. You can have a slumber party or birthday party with your friends and just play it in the background. There's a lot of great songs by Miranda, The Ting Tings, <a href=#>Ke$ha</a>, Leona Lewis, and then we have the whole iCarly cast singing. I have a song on it. It's a fun soundtrack!" Any playlist or album that incorporates music from so many cool artists deserves to be listened to!</p><h2 id=nathan-kress-on-michelle-obama-s-cameo-appearance><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Nathan Kress On Michelle Obama's Cameo Appearance</span></h2><p>When <a href=#>Michelle Obama</a> made a guest appearance on the episode of iCarly called "iMeet The First Lady", Nathan Kress thought she did awesomely. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He said</a>,&nbsp;"She did really well! We were very impressed. She's in two very large scenes and she had a ton of dialogue. It would have even been tough for us and we've been doing it for years and this is her TV debut as far as sitcoms go, but she nailed the takes one after another." This is certainly not the only show Michelle Obama has guest-starred in over the years!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=miranda-cosgrove-on-her-fave-cast-members-to-work-with><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Miranda Cosgrove On Her Fave Cast Members To Work With</span></h2><p>When asked about which of her costars was the best person to work with on the set of their show, Miranda Cosgrove played it safe and named them all. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She replied</a>, "Jenette McCurdy, Nathan Kress, and especially Jerry Trainor, who plays my brother in the show [iCarly]. He's like a real-life big brother to me. He gave me my first driving lesson." She made sure not to leave anyone out so that everyone felt included.</p><h2 id=jennette-mccurdy-on-feeling-embarrassed-looking-back><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jennette McCurdy On Feeling Embarrassed Looking Back</span></h2><p>Jennette McCurdy has made it clear that she is no longer interested in being an actress anymore. Her reason? <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She explained</a>, "I resent my career in a lot of ways. I feel so unfulfilled by the roles that I played. I imagine there's a very different experience to be had with acting if you're proud of your roles, and if you feel fulfilled by them." Maybe if the right movie or TV show role comes her way, she will reconsider returning to the world of acting down the line.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nathan-kress-on-his-icarly-vivid-dreams><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Nathan Kress On His 'iCarly' Vivid Dreams</span></h2><p>Nathan Kress not only starred in iCarly... but he's dreamed about the show too! <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">When asked about his dreams he said</a>, "Ironically enough, the dream I had last night was one of the few that I actually remember. I dreamt the whole iCarly cast was supposed to be on a talk show together, but I kept getting lost and distracted in a gigantic mall, so I missed my flight and couldn't be on the show."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>How 'Nickelodeon's' Miranda Cosgrove Made Her $10 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>He continued, "To top it off, I accidentally crashed a fancy futuristic elevator and everyone got mad at me! If anyone wants to offer an interpretation of what that dream means, I'm all ears." That doesn't sound like a dream we can decipher but it probably makes some sort of subconscious sense.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=noah-munck-on-how-icarly-impacted-his-life><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Noah Munck On How 'iCarly' Impacted His Life</span></h2><p>Noah Munck isn't continuing life as an actor or joining in with the iCarly revival. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He talked about his past time on the show saying</a>, "I got iCarly and that kind of just like was the role that took me for 5 years. It was really cool, this big show was 5 years of my life and it was a really cool experience and time altogether." 5 years is certainly a long time-- especially for a young person. Heis ready to pursue other interests now.</p><h2 id=jennette-mccurdy-on-resenting-the-character-she-played><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Jennette McCurdy On Resenting The Character She Played</span></h2><p>Jennette McCurdy simply isn't fond of the character she once played and it even contributed to her having an eating disorder. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She explained</a>, "My great 'contribution' to society was walking onto an overlit Nickelodeon set shouting lines about fried chicken (my character liked fried chicken) and that's what kids were looking up to?"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>15 Surprising Facts About Miranda Cosgrove After iCarly's End</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She went on to say, "Granted, we can't all be [American Buddhist nun] Pema Chodron, but there was something about the shallowness of my success that made me resent it. That resentment festered, providing even more fuel for my disordered eating. I actively began to engage in anorexic behavior again." It is very understandable why she is no longer interested in continuing a career as an actress.</p><h2 id=jerry-trainor-on-his-favorite-episode-of-icarly><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jerry Trainor On His Favorite Episode Of 'iCarly'</span></h2><p>Jerry Trainor played the role of Carly's older brother in the show. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">When asked about his favorite episode he said</a>, "My favorite was the 'iGet Pranky,'&nbsp;when Spencer was addicted to pranking and they were trying to get him to stop. The rehearsal for that was so fun. It was very high-energy and I was running from person to person pranking them." This episode is one of the highest-rated episodes from the entire show.</p><h2 id=miranda-cosgrove-on-relating-to-the-character-of-carly><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Miranda Cosgrove On Relating To The Character Of Carly</span></h2><p>Miranda Cosgrove and her fictional character, Carly Shay, had a lot in common. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She explained</a>, "I am a lot like Carly. The writer puts in a lot of lines that are like things that I say in real life during rehearsal. Carly&nbsp;freaks out a little more than I do, though -- when things go wrong, she goes really insane." It is probably so much easier to play the role of a character you can resonate with and Miranda actually had that!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>What Has Daniella Monet Been Up To Since 'iCarly'?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGignJmiocZuttSsq2agmal6r7HTn6OisF2dsrOx0mauoZmkYsGpsYycmKysXam1qrrKrGSonl2ptaZ50qGmsGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./frank-mir-net-worth-how-much-is-frank-mir-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Frank Mir Net Worth How Much is Frank Mir Worth?</span></a>
