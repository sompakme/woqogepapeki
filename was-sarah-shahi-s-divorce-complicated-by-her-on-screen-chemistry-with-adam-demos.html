After all, Shahi has starred in several notable TV shows, and she even landed a starring role in a major superhero movie, Black Adam.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now that Shahi has been enjoying so much success, the media has been paying a lot of attention to her. In some cases, that is a pretty good thing since fans enjoy learning <a href=#>how much Shahi enjoyed working with Dwayne Johnson</a> on Black Adam.</p><p>Sadly, however, some things that the media has reported about Shahi have left observers with big questions. A perfect example of that is some fans are concerned about the allegations that were made about <a href=#>Shahi allegedly mistreating her former nanny</a>.</p><p>In recent years, the story about Shahi that people have been wondering about the most is her divorce from her ex-husband, Steve Howey. Most notably, some observers have been wondering if Shahi's co-star and boyfriend Adam Demos played any role in her marriage ending.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-long-were-sarah-shahi-and-steve-howey-married>How Long Were Sarah Shahi And Steve Howey Married?</h2><p>When a celebrity couple is together for more than a decade, their fans tend to learn a fair amount about them. With that in mind, it shouldn't surprise anyone that following Sarah Shahi and Steve Howey's divorce, US Weekly was able to put together <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a relationship timeline for them</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Is Steve Howey’s Wife’s Net Worth After Their Divorce?</a></span></p><p>Thanks to that relationship timeline, it is clear that Shahi and Howey met when she was cast in an episode of his show, Reba. After they met, Howey and Shahi became a couple and then got engaged in 2007.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sarah-shahl-and-steve-howey-s-family.jpg><p>More than five years after Shahi and Howey met, they wound up walking down the aisle in 2009. That same year, Howey and Shahi became parents for the first time, and they went on to welcome twins into the world years later in 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sadly for the couple, in early-2016. Howey made an appearance on the "Talk Nerdy With Us" podcast where he said that becoming parents "almost broke us up" while talking about his marriage. As Howey explained, it was not having any energy left for each other at the end of the day that almost ended their marriage at that time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Steve-Howey-and-Sarah-Shahi.jpg><p>Despite hitting a rough patch during the mid-2010s, Shahi and Howey were able to work things out at that time. In fact, both of them would go on to profess their love and admiration for each other on social media several times in the years that followed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-adam-demos-the-reason-sarah-shahi-and-steve-howey-got-divorced>Is Adam Demos The Reason Sarah Shahi And Steve Howey Got Divorced?</h2><p>For a long time, Sarah Shahi and Steve Howey's fans thought the couple was going to go the distance. After all, it said a lot about the pair's commitment to each other when their marriage survived the rough patch in their relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is Steve Howey's Life After 'Shameless'</a></span></p><p>In the end, Shahi and Howey decided to separate in April 2020 according to court documents obtained by US Weekly. Then, things were taken to another level when Shahi filed for divorce roughly a month after their separation began.</p><p>In early-2021, US Weekly reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shahi and Howey had finalized their divorce</a>. Before their marriage came to an official end, the world learned that Shahi moved on to a relationship with her co-star Adam Demos only months after she filed for divorce.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/adam-demos-fit-body-shirtless-sex_life.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In cases where someone quickly finds a new mate after getting divorced, it is common for observers to ask themselves questions. In this case, some observers wondered if Shahi's feelings for Demos played any role in her divorce.</p><p>As of the time of this writing, there is no way to definitively state if Demos inspired Shahi to end her marriage to Howey. That said, based on the available information, it does seem unlikely that Demos complicated Shahi and Howey's divorce.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sarah-shahl-looking-confident.jpg><p>The first reason to think that Demos wasn't a stumbling block in Shahi and Howey's divorce seems extremely noteworthy. Based on the publicly available information, there is no indication that Shahi and Howey's divorce was contentious.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it was announced that Shahi and Howey were getting divorced, the former couple put out a joint statement about the situation.</p><p>More importantly, Howey and Shahi didn't engage in a long legal battle during their divorce which can be an indication of a bitter split. Howey and Shahi are sharing custody of their kids, neither of them sought alimony and there haven't been any reports of bad blood between them.</p><p>Since Shahi and Howey seem to have handled their marriage ending as maturely as anyone can, that makes it very unlikely that anything dramatic led to their divorce.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened Between Steve Howey And Ex-Wife Sarah Shahi?</a></span></p><p>Another thing to keep in mind when considering if Demos affected Shahi and Howey's divorce is the timing of everything.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it was announced that Howey and Shahi were getting divorced, she hadn't even begun working on Sex/Life with Demos yet. After all, US Weekly reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the first season of Sex/Life was filmed in "fall 2020"</a> and Shahi filed for divorce earlier that year.</p><p>Given that the timeline seems to rule out that Demos played any role in causing Shahi's divorce, that begs a different question. How did Shahi and Demos get involved so quickly after she filed for divorce?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sarah-shahl-and-adam-demos-happy-together.jpg><p>Thankfully for anyone looking to understand the timeline of Shahi and Demos' relationship, they aren't shy about <a href=#>discussing their relationship</a>. Based on what she told People in 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shahi was smitten with Demos from the moment they met</a> in August 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I said, 'Well, that's a tall drink of water.' When I first met Adam, I was really blown away with him. We met in the makeup trailer and we just got on instantly. We had the exact same taste in music. We had the same taste in whiskey and tequilas and I was really blown away by him just as a person and all I knew was that I wanted more."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqmqqRnXq0tMChoGarpJrDpnnHqK6esV2Ztre70ZycZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGLEqsDHZpidmZ1isaa5zqxm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./top-20-most-ridiculous-names-celebs-have-given-their-children.html><span>←</span><span>Top 20 Most Ridiculous Names Celebs Have Given Their Children</span></a>
