His longtime publicist Mara Buxbaum confirmed the Oscar winner’s death to <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> in a statement, which read: “Robin Williams passed away this morning. He has been battling severe depression of late. This is a tragic and sudden loss. The family respectfully asks for their privacy as they grieve during this very difficult time.”</p><p>Find out what his former costars, friends, admirers, and peers remembered of the late actor and comic below.</p><p><strong>Pam Dawber:</strong>&nbsp;“I am completely and totally devastated,” Williams’&nbsp;Mork and Mindy&nbsp;costar said. “What more can be said?”</p><p><strong>President Barack Obama:</strong> “Robin Williams was an airman, a doctor, a genie, a nanny, a president, a professor, a bangarang Peter Pan, and everything in between. But he was one of a kind. He arrived in our lives as an alien — but he ended up touching every element of the human spirit,” Obama said in an official statement Monday evening. “He made us laugh. He made us cry. He gave his immeasurable talent freely and generously to those who needed it most — from our troops stationed abroad to the marginalized on our own streets. The Obama family offers our condolences to Robin’s family, his friends, and everyone who found their voice and their verse thanks to Robin Williams.”</p><p><strong>Sally Field:</strong> “I feel stunned and so sad about Robin. I’m sad for the world of comedy. And so very sad for his family. And I’m sad for Robin. He always lit up when he was able to make people laugh, and he made them laugh his whole life long…. tirelessly. He was one of a kind. There will not be another. Please God, let him now rest in peace.”</p><p><strong>Steven Spielberg:</strong> “Robin was a lightning storm of comic genius and our laughter was the thunder that sustained him. He was a pal and I can’t believe he’s gone.”</p><p><strong>Mara Wilson ‏@MaraWritesStuff:&nbsp;</strong>Very sad, very upset, very glad I did not have to hear about this though Twitter.

This is so sad. #RobinWilliams. I met him when I was 13 and a huge fan and he was so kind and I watched him be kind to every fan i ever saw him with…And with other actors he was so generous and brilliant. He made everyone feel special and equal around him even though he was the genius…His heart was so big and even if you didn’t know him, what he gave everyone was that same spirit in his work, so we all felt it…His impact on the world was so positive. He did so much good for people. He made me and so many people laugh so hard for a very long time.

Robin’s commitment as an artist to lifting our mood and making us happy is compared to none.

I never could have expected this ending to his life, and to ours with him. God bless him and God bless us all for his LIFE! I cannot believe this. I am overwhelmed with grief.
