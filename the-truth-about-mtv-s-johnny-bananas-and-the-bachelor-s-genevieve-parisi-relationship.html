This year, one of the most drama-filled women on the beach is Genevieve Parisi. Genevieve was one of the first to arrive in paradise, and has remained on the beach for the entire season so far. She began the trip with a short romance with Justin Glaze, but ended things with him to be with Aaron Clancy.</p><p>Genevieve and Aaron's relationship began with drama because he saw her kiss Justin right after she returned from her date with Aaron. After that, the couple became a mainstay on the beach, but they tend to have heated arguments and a lot of crying.</p><p>Then there is Johnny Bananas. It seems that there was a spark between Genevieve and the MTV star.</p><h2 id=who-is-johnny-bananas><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Who Is Johnny Bananas?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Johnny Devenanzio is one of the <a href=#>most infamous and long-running contestants on MTV's The Challenge.</a> He has competed in 20 seasons and won many of them. He accumulated over $1 million from all of his wins, and caused plenty of chaos along the way. He has also been in numerous commercials.</p><p>Johnny is also known for his stunts.

Genevieve commented on an Instagram post that seemed to praise Aaron, “Creating drama from nothing, at someone else’s expense who actually has a heart and isn’t ‘playing a game,’ shouldn’t be praised,” she wrote. “That’s sad.”</p><p>Before that, Aaron posted after the episode aired with their fight, “Guys truly not the convo at all,” he tweeted. “Like, 40 hours of filming a week condensed into four hours. You see such a small part!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Genevieve shot back, “Nothing relevant to the argument was cut out,” she wrote. “What you saw is what happened.”</p><h2 id=will-johnny-bananas-make-an-appearance-on-bachelor-in-paradise><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Will Johnny Bananas Make An Appearance On Bachelor In Paradise?</span></h2><p>It was recently revealed that the MTV star was in talks to make a cameo on Bachelor in Paradise.</p><p>One rumor was that he would pop up on the beach to make trouble between Aaron and Genevieve.
