The 43-year-old is enjoying a <a href=#>new romantic fling with musician Bobby Wooten III</a>. The pair were set up by a mutual friend a few months ago, but they’ve already hit it off, and they were even spotted <a href=#>sharing a passionate kiss</a> back in May.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Dawson’s Creek star is said to be enjoying her new relationship, according to a source close to the couple. “Katie is excited about seeing someone and is very happy. She enjoys having someone in her life, and he is very kind and good to her,” the said source <a href=#>told E! News</a>.</p><p>As with many of her colleagues in Hollywood, Holmes has been in a number of relationships, including <a href=#>with fellow actor Joshua Jackson</a>, and – more recently, with New York-based chef Emilio Vitolo Jr.</p><p>The actress was also for a time famously married to Tom Cruise, who is the father of her 16-year-old daughter, Suri. She was also once engaged to American Pie star, Chris Klein.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened To Katie Holmes After Her Split From Emilio Vitolo Jr.?</a></span></p><p>One past Holmes relationship that is not quite talked about as much is her fling with Jamie Foxx.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=inside-katie-holmes-rsquo-relationship-with-jamie-foxx>Inside Katie Holmes’ Relationship With Jamie Foxx</h2><p>The first signs of a romantic relationship between Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx became apparent in early 2015, when the pair were spotted holding hands. In a report that was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">published on Us Weekly</a> at the time, it was revealed that they had apparently been seeing each other for more than a year.</p><p>“Jamie is someone [Katie] can trust and have fun with,” an insider to the relationship reportedly said to the publication. “She’s getting everything from Jamie that she didn’t get with Tom [Cruise].”</p><p>Holmes’ marriage to Cruise did not end well, amidst fears by the actress that the Top Gun actor had designs on abducting their daughter and using his connections in the Church of Scientology to intimidate her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps as a result of this history, Holmes and Foxx appeared to work hard to keep their relationship as private as possible. Still, they continued to attend red carpet events together, although they never spoke out a lot about seeing each other.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Tom Cruise Still Talk To His Daughter Suri Since Splitting With Katie Holmes?</a></span></p><p>The superstar couple were together for about six years, until they broke things off in 2019.</p><h2 id=why-did-katie-holmes-and-jamie-foxx-break-up>Why Did Katie Holmes And Jamie Foxx Break Up?</h2><p>Six years of dating is a significant period – especially in Hollywood. Having been together for that long, things were starting to look really serious between Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx. In fact, there was widespread speculation that they would end up married.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, things took a turn for the worse in late spring 2019, and their love story ended rather suddenly. At least that’s how it appeared from the outside looking in. The lovebirds were said to have planned a vacation at Montauk for Memorial Day weekend that year, but trouble started to brew in paradise, and it all came falling apart.</p><p>Two different sources <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spoke to Page Six</a> on the story, and provided seemingly contradictory accounts of what transpired. “Katie called two hours before he was supposed to get on a plane from LA to NYC and canceled. He was really upset,” the first source alleged.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jamie Foxx Wishes He Had Dated This Actress</a></span></p><p>The other purported insider placed the blame firmly at Foxx’s door: “Katie was supposed to go to Montauk to join Jamie, but he did something sh*tty at the last minute, and that was that. He canceled on his own and never got on the plane.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-jamie-foxx-still-single-since-splitting-up-with-katie-holmes>Is Jamie Foxx Still Single Since Splitting Up With Katie Holmes?</h2><p>Despite their relatively prolonged time together, there were some fans who thought that Katie Holmes’ relationship with Jamie Foxx was <a href=#>nothing more than a ruse</a>. This was not the case, however, only that the curtains finally drew on them as a couple.</p><p>“[Their relationship] ran its course. This industry is very tough on relationships,” a friend of the pair was quoted saying in the aftermath, while also insisting that there was no bad blood: “Jamie thinks Katie is an incredible human being. They had a very, very deep connection. They brought each other a lot of joy and laughter.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following his split from Holmes, Foxx was rumored to be involved with 20-year-old musician Sela Vave. The actor was categorical, though, that this was not the case. “People are saying I’m dating the girl, let me just say this, that’s absolutely not true,” Foxx said.</p><p>The Ray star has also been linked with his Dad Stop Embarrassing Me co-star, Natalie Friedman. This too, is unconfirmed, however. Officially, Jamie Foxx remains a single man.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Katie Holmes Fans Say They 'Miss' Her And Jamie Foxx & Claim New BF Is 'Using Her'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYr%2BmrculsGagkaW9prrEnWSbnaSssqa6jKSYraGVYrWwuMyeqmaZnpl6q63Mopxmnp%2BtxXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./terica-ellis.html><span>←</span><span>Terica Ellis</span></a>
