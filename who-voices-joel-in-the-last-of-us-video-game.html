Yes. / Cannot wait to see what I learn about Joel from Pedro. / Buckle up, y’all. We goin for a ride.”</strong></p><p>Although unable to reprise his role in the show, Baker was not entirely left out of the process.&nbsp;</p><p>Co-creators Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann asked Baker to host the companion podcast to the series, offering insight into the adaptation.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, Baker was also given a cameo as a minor antagonist in Episode 8 of the show, showcasing the creators’ fidelity to the source material.</p><p>Baker compared the show to a compliment rather than an adaptation of the original, highlighting the insights into Joel’s character that he gained from Pascal’s performance.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with CBR, Baker explained how “small, seemingly insignificant” decisions in Pascal’s performance made him rethink Joel’s character.&nbsp;</p><p>He also recounted a surreal moment on set, reflecting on how far he has come since his early acting career in radio commercials.</p><p>Baker’s extensive experience in voice acting includes prominent roles in video game franchises such as Uncharted, BioShock, Final Fantasy, and <a href=#>God of War</a>, as well as dub work for popular Japanese anime properties and American animation.&nbsp;</p><p>He is regarded as a legend in the industry, having voiced characters such as <a href=#>Batman</a>, the Joker, Hawkeye, and Loki, among many others.</p><p>Baker is one of many original cast members to join the production.

With its talented cast and creators, the show will surely be a success among game fans and newcomers to the story.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunDDx6hkr6eZmLK0ecmonKVlmaN6tbTEZqOaq6RivKd51Kxkr6GUmrxus8CmnGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./timothy-shalloway-biography-age-nationality-instagram-movies-family-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Timothy Shalloway Biography, Age, Nationality, Instagram, Movies, Family, Net worth</span></a>
