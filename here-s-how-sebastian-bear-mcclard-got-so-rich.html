The former couple surprised a lot of fans when they had a city hall wedding in 2018, given that Ratajkowski and Bear-McClard had not been dating for that long. More surprising still to fans was that Bear-McClard appeared to be very out of Ratajkowski's league.</p><p>How Ratajkowski ended up with someone who's relatively unknown is a bit of a mystery. But the Inamorata swimsuit line owner has been one to always date non-celebrities. At times, Ratajkowski's intentions have been questioned. But Ratajkowksi has never been one to defend her choices about who she dates, living life by her own terms.</p><p>In 2019, Bear-McClard made headlines for allegedly owing his <strong>landlord $120,000 for dodging about two years of rent in a $4,900-a-month apartment</strong> in NoHo, an expensive location in Manhattan, New York. The scandal had fans wondering who this man was. It was not until Ratajkowski made a statement, that fans learned more about Bear-McClard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here's what we know.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/did-the-allegations-against-sebastian-bear-mcclard-affect-his-career-and-net-worth_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Did The Allegations Against Sebastian Bear-McClard Affect His Career And Net Worth?">Did The Allegations Against Sebastian Bear-McClard Affect His Career And Net Worth?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>When Sebastian Bear-McClard was accused of misconduct in March 2023, these allegations could have changed his career forever.</p><p><strong>Updated March 2024: </strong>In March 2023, <strong>Sebastian Bear-McClard was accused of sexual misconduct.</strong> The allegations state that Bear-McClard groomed underage girls in 2016 and 2017 by reaching out via social media to ask them to audition for films. But instead, there was no film offer. Something that Bear-McClard's former partners, the Safdie Brothers learned about in 2022 and severed ties with Bear-McClard for an undisclosed amount immediately upon hearing the news. To date, formal charges have not been brought against Bear-McClard as a result of the allegations against him.</p><h2 id=how-much-sebastian-bear-mcclard-is-worth>How Much Sebastian Bear-McClard Is Worth</h2><h3 id=net-worth-15-million>Net Worth: $15 Million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/instar49631526-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The reason many fans used to believe that Ratajkowski was in it for Bear-McClard's money was because of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his once reported $15 million net worth</a>. That is nearly double the model's net worth, which is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated to be around $8 million</a>. But the two had known each other for quite some time before they got together. They'd been in the same group of friends for years. Ratajkowski even said that she already had a feeling Bear-McClard might be "the one" before they started dating.</p><p>"We knew each other for a long time before and he [Bear-McClard] likes to joke like, 'Yeah, everyone thinks we got married quickly but you vetted me for two years," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she told Busy Tonight</a>.

The Truth About His Life Before Marrying And Divorcing Emily Ratajkowski</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Sebastian Bear-McClard isn't only famous for being the ex-husband of well-known model Emily Ratajkowski.</p><p>Many fans bet their marriage wouldn't last because of how fast their relationship escalated, plus their 11-year age gap. As it turns out, fans were right, given that <strong>Ratajkowski and Bear-McClard divorced in 2022</strong>. The two have one child together, Sylvester Apollo Bear.</p><h2 id=sebastian-bear-mcclard-comes-from-a-family-of-artists>Sebastian Bear-McClard Comes From A Family Of Artists</h2><h3 id=sebastian-bear-mcclard-39-s-mother-is-a-filmmaker-writer-and-activist-and-his-father-is-a-modern-art-artist>Sebastian Bear-McClard's mother is a filmmaker, writer and activist and his father is a modern-art artist</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/instar49317743-1.jpg><p>When Ratajkowski came to Bear-McClard's defense during the rent scandal, she wrote on Twitter, "He was raised in the neighborhood he lives in now, both of his parents are artists who were priced out of their homes in downtown New York."</p><p>Indeed, Bear-McClard's mother Liza Bear is a filmmaker, writer, and activist. She co-founded the '70s art magazines Avalance and Bomb. Michael McClard, his father, is an artist who's had exhibits at New York City's Museum of Modern art.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Sources once said that Bear alone had a total net worth of $96 million as of 2021, mostly from his directing career.</strong> There aren't that many public details about McClard's works and net worth. However, Em Rata denied rumors of her husband's privileged upbringing. She even pulled the struggling artist card in defending him during the rent controversy.</p><h2 id=sebastian-bear-mcclard-is-an-independent-movie-producer>Sebastian Bear-McClard Is An Independent Movie Producer</h2><h3 id=sebastian-bear-mcclard-has-produced-11-projects>Sebastian Bear-McClard has produced 11 projects</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/sebastian-bear-mcclard-at-the-la-premier-of-uncut-gems.jpg><p>"He’s an independent movie producer so people thinking he’s rich is real nice but not based in fact," Ratajkowski wrote on Twitter in defense of her husband.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bear-McClard has in fact worked as a director, writer, producer, and actor. He is a partner of the production company Elara Pictures with the Safdie Brothers and Oscar Boyson. He also produced the American crime thriller <a href=#>Uncut Gems starring Adam Sandler</a>.</p><p><strong>The movie earned an impressive $50 million</strong>. Sales for the ticket were even described as "a testament to the power of an original and exhilarating movie with an unexpected performance from an iconic comedy star" by senior Comscore analyst, Paul Dergarabedian. But Bear-McClard's other projects weren't really as huge.</p><p>He produced the psychological drama film Heaven Knows What in 2014 and Good Time starring Robert Pattinson in 2017. These films earned around 1/4 or even less of what Uncut Gems made.</p><p>Some other projects that Bear-McClard has produced, according to IMDb include:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>48 Hours (TV Show)</p></td><td><p>2023</p></td><td><p>Producer</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Funny Pages (Movie)</p></td><td><p>2022</p></td><td><p>Producer</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Bodies Bodies Bodies (Movie)</p></td><td><p>2022</p></td><td><p>Executive Producer</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Chillin' Island (TV Series)</p></td><td><p>2021-2022</p></td><td><p>Executive Producer</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>When the dust finally settled with the rent controversy, Ratajkowski and Bear-McClard were paid to move out. They apparently misused a state loft law that was meant to support real starving artists. After the settlement, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they bought a $2 million home in L.A</a>. Not bad, but that only confirms that Ratajkowski's ex-husband was definitely no struggling artist at the time.</p><p>Source: Comscore, IMDb</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqnpqRqMGqrc1mmZ6ZomK6pK%2FLmqmdZaKesKl5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8GpeZBuZKahnKG2sLqO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./grand-paragon-hotel-jakarta-indonesia.html><span>←</span><span>Grand Paragon Hotel, Jakarta, Indonesia</span></a>
