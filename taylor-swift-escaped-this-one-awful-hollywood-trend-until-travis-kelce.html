Fans might have expected some engagement rumors to come from Travis and Taylor ahead of possible baby news, but there's one simple reason why the gossip started, and why it started now.</p><h2 id=does-taylor-swift-even-want-kids>Does Taylor Swift Even Want Kids?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/this-is-how-taylor-swift-spends-her-billion-dollar-net-worth-1.jpg><p>Taylor Swift was, of course, born in 1989 (who could forget, since she titled an album for the year?).

Notably, in 2019, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor was asked whether she was planning on having kids soon</a>, and she had an epic response to the question.</p><p>I don't really think men are asked that question when they turn 30, so I'm not going to answer that now.</p><p>Far earlier, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">when Taylor Swift was 24, she told interviewers that she didn't know if she would have kids</a> because, "It's impossible not to picture certain scenarios and how you would try to convince them that they have a normal life when, inevitably, there will be strange men pointing giant cameras at them from the time they are babies."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There was some seemingly gentle speculation about Taylor and Joe one day having kids together, but it didn't make headlines as much as Taylor and Travis have already.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/travis-kelce-in-promo-for-catching-kelce.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Travis Kelce Only Agreed To A Reality Dating Show For The Money">Travis Kelce Only Agreed To A Reality Dating Show For The Money</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>'Catching Kelce' was Travis Kelce's first brush with fame outside the NFL, but he didn't really want to do the reality dating show to begin with.</p><p>Notably, Taylor and Joe were together for six years; <strong>Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift were only confirmed to be dating for less than two months when baby rumors began</strong>.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Travis publicly praised Taylor and talked about trying to give her his number</a> in July 2023, by early September they were "talking," and by September 24th Taylor was rubbing elbows with Kelce's mom at a football game.</p><p>Things definitely happened fast, and at that point, Travis was still keeping pretty quiet about his growing relationship with Taylor.

Others seem to suggest Taylor is super-serious about Travis and that he's the kind of guy she's just been waiting for.</p><p>In fact, Life & Style's source flat out said, "He’s exactly the guy she’s been waiting for!" To suggest that Taylor has been waiting around for a guy — any guy — to fulfill an assumed life dream of getting married and having babies seems way off, especially considering Taylor's commentary on the subject over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/taylor-swift-9.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Taylor Swift’s Ex Joe Alwyn Is Worried About Her New Relationship With Travis Kelce">Taylor Swift’s Ex Joe Alwyn Is Worried About Her New Relationship With Travis Kelce</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor is acting differently in her relationship with Travis Kelce and people are beginning to notice.</p><p>Whether she wants kids or not, it seems disingenuous to suggest that Taylor Swift, of all people, has been waiting around for a man, let alone one to have kids with.</p><p>While only time will tell whether Taylor does want marriage and babies with Travis Kelce, it's just as safe to assume she doesn't want kids at all — and the media doesn't get to decide that for her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lpKeut7XSZqKepJOaeqOtwbJkq62dpL%2B0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meet-norah-weinstein-father-howard-gottfried-and-mother-wendy-gottfried-family-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Meet Norah Weinstein Father Howard Gottfried And Mother Wendy Gottfried, Family And Net Worth</span></a>
