Former NBC anchor <strong>Jenna Wolfe</strong> underwent her second surgery since testing positive for the BRCA-1 <a href=#>breast cancer</a> gene earlier this year.</p><p>“Mastectomy behind me,” the journalist, 49, captioned an <a href=#>Instagram photo</a> of herself in the hospital on Wednesday, April 12. “All that’s left now is recovery and healing… The most important part. The hardest part. I FaceTimed with my kids tonight and the little [one] said to me, ‘you always say we can do hard things, mama. Now we’re telling you the same thing. You got this. We love you.’”</p><p>Wolfe — who shares kids Harper, 9, and Quinn, 8, with partner <strong>Stephanie Gosk</strong> — shared more glimpses into her <a href=#>post-surgery recovery</a> via her Instagram Stories. “That’s my mom, who just beat stage 3 breast cancer, sleeping on the couch in the hospital by my side,” she captioned a video on Wednesday, adding, “I’m a lucky girl.”</p><p>The reporter shared another update later that day. “Heading home,” she captioned an Instagram Story pic of herself dressed in regular clothes. “It’s time to heal … everything.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Former-NBC-Anchor-Jenna-Wolfe-Healing-After-Undergoing-Mastectomy-Following-Breast-Cancer-Gene-Diagnosis-073.jpg><p>Last month, the <a href=#>Today</a> alum revealed her diagnosis via a <a href=#>lengthy Instagram post</a>. “About a month ago, I tested positive for the BRCA-1 breast cancer gene (meaning <a href=#>my chances of getting</a> breast and ovarian cancer are … well … really high), leaving me little wiggle room to ‘mull over my choices,’” she wrote on March 29. “So without a ton of options, I stared down my fears, took a deep breath and opted for two pretty big surgeries.”</p><p>Wolfe — who left her role as a Today correspondent and Weekend Today co-anchor in 2015 — continued: “My hysterectomy is the first. It’s not fun, not easy, not at all pleasant (I’m terrified of needles) but it’s something I need to do. The second surgery, the bigger one, will be in 2 weeks. Happy to share more with anyone <a href=#>going through something similar</a>.”</p><p>She went on to admit that she was scared about how her health update would affect her and her family’s lives, before noting, “But I also know I have to let myself be scared sometimes to learn how to overcome it.”</p><p>The TV personality wrapped up her post by stating, “But with anything in life, <a href=#>the only way is through</a>. And I’m going through. I realize everyone has a story. This is mine. (Well, it’s part of mine). As I embark on it, I’ll be thinking about you and yours.”</p><p>Wolfe and Gosk, 50, became parents with the <a href=#>birth of their daughter Harper</a> in 2013. In a blog post <a href=#>announcing the news</a>, Wolfe also <a href=#>came out as gay</a>. “Two years into a great relationship we felt like we wanted to share our adventures with a wide-eyed, little person,” she wrote in March 2013. “The more we talked about it, the better the idea seemed. And so in December, we embarked on Operation Baby. And might I just add that despite the morning sickness, it’s been the best decision we’ve ever made.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>That same month, she shut <a href=#>denied speculation</a> that NBC Nightly News host <a href=#><strong>Lester Holt</strong></a> or former Today anchor <a href=#><strong>Matt Lauer</strong></a> were her child’s biological father. Rather, Wolfe said she and the NBC News correspondent chose to keep the biological father’s identity “under wraps.”</p><p>Two years later, the couple <a href=#>welcomed their second child</a>, daughter Quinn, in February 2015. “The three of us. Pretty amazing stuff Baby Quinn,” Gosk <a href=#>wrote via Twitter</a> alongside a pic of herself and Wolfe with their newborn at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGafp6KisrN5zZuaZpmemLWwvoyjnKemkWLEsLjFnmShnZGhtq%2BzjJqdrZ2iYrqiv9Oemq2nna58</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fe4rless-biography-age-face-girlfriend-cause-of-death-net-worth-real-name-tiktok-voice-chang.html><span>←</span><span>Fe4RLess Biography: Age, Face, Girlfriend, Cause Of Death, Net Worth, Real Name, TikTok, Voice Chang</span></a>
