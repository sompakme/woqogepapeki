In some cases, those interviews have gone down in history like the time <a href=# rel=nofollow>Steve Martin paid tribute to David Letterman</a>.</p><p>Over the last several years, Steve Martin and Martin Short have been working together, so they've made talk show appearances together. During one of Steve Martin and Martin Short's appearances on The Tonight Show, the host <strong><a href=# rel=nofollow>Jimmy Fallon</a></strong> may have been called out for being phony.</p><h2 id=are-steve-martin-and-martin-short-really-friends>Are Steve Martin And Martin Short Really Friends?</h2><p>Since 2021, Steve Martin and Martin Short have been co-starring in Only Murders in the Building together alongside Selena Gomez. Before that, the two legends have been touring and performing comedy for adoring fans since 2015.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/martin-short-selena-gomez-and-steve-martin-at-the-la-premiere-of-only-murders-in-the-building-season-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As anyone familiar with Steve Martin and Short's careers should already know, the two men began working together off and on several decades ago. Between movies like Three Amigos! and the Father of the Bride films, they have proven to be fantastic when they share a screen.</p><p>Throughout music history, however, it has been obvious that just because performers work together for years doesn't mean they actually like each other. With that in mind, it begs an obvious question, are Short and Steve Martin actually friends in real life?</p><p>Since Short and Steve Martin have very sarcastic senses of humor, fans don't expect them to regularly pay sincere tribute to each other. Instead, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Short has a long history of mocking Steve Martin in public</a> and vice versa.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Kathie Lee Gifford Had To Apologize To Martin Short After She Completely Forgot His Wife Had Passed Away During Their Interview</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thankfully for fans who want to know the truth, Steve Martin and Short have rarely been sincere about their bond. In 2021, Short explained to InStyle that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">he and Steve Martin have remained close</a> ever since the two of them and Chevy Chase began socializing.</p><p>"If you make someone laugh or they make you laugh, you want more of that. When the film wrapped, we started having dinners, the three of us and our wives. And it just continued on. There was never a phase where I didn't see Steve for a couple of years."</p><p>Because Steve Martin was being interviewed by InStyle at the same time, he chimed in to reveal when his friendship with Short went to another level. "We worked together in the Father of the Bride movies. So we were together more and had time to really develop a friendship."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-steve-martin-and-martin-short-call-jimmy-fallon-phony>Did Steve Martin And Martin Short Call Jimmy Fallon Phony?</h2><p>Since Jimmy Fallon joined the cast of Saturday Night Live in 1998, he has amassed a massive fan following. As a result, Fallon has been able to enjoy an incredible amount of success as a performer and host.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jimmy-fallon-the-tonight-show.jpg><p>In 2009, Fallon began hosting Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, and it didn't take long for it to seem like NBC loved working with him. After years of hosting that show, Fallon got a promotion when he took over the most legendary talk show in history, The Tonight Show.</p><p>While all of that success allowed Fallon to amass an incredible fortune, there is no doubt that fame can be a double-edged sword. For all of Fallon's fans and followers, there is no denying that he has just as many, if not more, detractors in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unsurprisingly, Fallon's staff have criticized him in the past including the time he was called out for how he handled the writer's strike. That aside, the truth is that many <a href=# rel=nofollow>members of Fallon's staff are very complimentary of him</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Jimmy Fallon Recalls Being Told To Enter Russell Brand's Dressing Room With Caution Prior To Their Tonight Show Interview</a></span></p><p>Of course, cynical people could conclude that Fallon's staffers compliment him in public simply to maintain connections. While that is a reasonable suspicion, the reality is that if Fallon's staff hated him and thought he is phony, the world would almost certainly know that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/did-steve-martin-and-martin-short-call-jimmy-fallon-out-for-being-fake-with-interview-guests_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the last several years, James Corden and Ellen DeGeneres have both been called out for how they treat people. If staffers couldn't stand Fallon, they would leak stories about him to the press or outright call him out in public.</p><p>No matter if Fallon's staffers love him or think he is fake, many viewers have drawn their own conclusions. In many cases, viewers have come to believe that Fallon is somewhat phony at the very least since they find it hard to believe he actually is as enthusiastic as he comes across on the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/steve-martin-and-martin-short-at-a-party.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anytime that Steve Martin or Martin Short appears on a talk show, the conversation moves very quickly. Since both comedic performers are extremely quick-witted and get away with saying things other stars can't, hosts often are on the receiving end of a barrage of insults when they appear.</p><p>Even by the standards of the way that Steve Martin and Short often mock talk show hosts, Jimmy Fallon was on the receiving end of something especially harsh. When the two long-time pals were interviewed by Fallon in 2019, things went off the rails immediately.</p><p>In the opening seconds of their 2019 Tonight Show appearance, Steve Martin and Short threw out a trio of quick jokes. After that, Short seemingly started to compliment Fallon and The Tonight Show only for his comments to turn into a roast of the host.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Jimmy Fallon Was Holding Back Tears After Taylor Swift Surprised Him With One Of The Most Emotional Moments On The Tonight Show</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"This is the greatest show on television because there's no host in late night that pretends to care the way you do. I mean no one captures phony-ness the way you do. It's a gift."</p><p>As Short made those comments, Fallon can be seen laughing, and he even lightly hit his fist on his desk to express how funny he found the actor's remarks. Fallon also repeatedly thanked Short as the legendary actor continued to call him fake.</p><p>While there is no doubt that Short's remarks were funny for viewers, it is easy to see how Fallon's feelings could be hurt. With that in mind, some viewers even labeled Fallon's response to Short's comment as phony.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/steve-martin-and-martin-short-on-the-tonight-show.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The first thing to note about this situation is that Steve Martin didn't say anything about Fallon being fake. On the other hand, Steve Martin certainly didn't disagree with what Short said, and it seems extremely likely that he might have said something similar.</p><p>More importantly, the thing that viewers have to note about what Short said is that his comments were meant as a joke. Between Steve Martin and Short, they also joked about Fallon having hidden weapons under his suit and him using illicit substances within seconds of the phony comments.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdqMGmwsRmpJqqpJ67brnAq6uipl2otbC%2B02aamqScYrequcyyZJ%2BZnKG8r3nOrqtmnp%2BneqOxyKeeZp6RoLJuw8itn2ahnqmys8LInq5mn6WawLW%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bob-sanders-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Bob Sanders Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
