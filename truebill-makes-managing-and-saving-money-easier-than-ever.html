On top of our everyday costs—like groceries or utility bills — we also have about a million subscriptions: Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, HBO Max, Spotify, Apple Music, HelloFresh, Birchbox…the list goes on and on.</p><p>It’s hard to simplify your expenses, especially when it feels like everything lately is marketed as a subscription. Which subscriptions are you wasting money on, and which do you still need?</p><p><strong>Here’s where <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Truebill</a> can help.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/truebill-app-subscription-list.jpg><p><strong>Try <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Truebill</a> for free today — and go Premium starting at just $3 a month!</strong></p><p>With over two million users and counting, Truebill is a personal finance app that has helped its members save over $100 million in the past five years. The main pillars of Truebill’s mission are to help you “save more, spend less, see everything and take back control of your financial life.” Certainly sounds like a plan to Us!</p><p>The app is free to use, but you can also sign up for Premium if you’d like extra features. We’ll go through some of our favorite features and benefits below!</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Truebill’s #1 feature</a> that certainly caught our eye is their subscriptions cancellation service. Truebill can instantly find and cancel useless subscriptions for you — so you can stop wasting money on the ones you don’t use. It even offers a Cancellations Concierge so you don’t have to sit on the phone with a scripted customer service rep for hours!</p><p>To give you a full breakdown of all your spending and earnings, Truebill connects to all of your bank accounts and credit cards. (Truebill never sells member data, so your information is completely safe.) But their amazing features don’t stop there. Truebill can also help you keep track of your spending by category and create a budget based on your personal spending habits. Each goal is easy to monitor in the app — you definitely don’t need to be a financial professional to manage your money here! Have a vacation coming up? Looking to build an emergency fund? Truebill can help you save for each category without you having to physically allocate the money yourself!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/truebill-app-months-spend.jpg><p><strong>Try <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Truebill</a> for free today — and go Premium starting at just $3 a month!</strong></p><p>Truebill can even lower your existing bills by negotiating on your behalf.

The app even keeps track of any suspicious activity, and it’ll let you know immediately if you have any fraudulent charges.</p><p>If you’ve been looking to get a better handle on your money, Truebill is the perfect place to start.
