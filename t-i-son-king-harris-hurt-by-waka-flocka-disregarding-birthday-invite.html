Growing up in the public eye as a star on his own family’s reality show&nbsp;<a href=#>The Family Hustle</a>, the public has watched him grow through life as a teenager.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Back in January, T.I. spoke on some of his son’s unfavorable actions during an interview on the Club Shay Shay&nbsp;podcast, hosted by Shannon Sharpe. In the sit-down, the “Bring ‘Em Out” rapper addressed his son’s run-ins with the law, and negative criticism he’s gotten regarding his parenting.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I have excellent communication with all my kids,” the father-of-six started. “I try to listen as much as I speak to them.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Sharing how his son feels about being the offspring of<a href=#>&nbsp;famous parents</a>, T.I. repeated King’s sentiments: “‘I just don’t want to be celebrities’ kid. I don’t want to live off of y’all’s success. I don’t wanna have to just be in y’all’s shadow.’”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“[King] wants a clean slate,” he shared. “I try to tell him he’ll never have that… You were born with it. You can’t give it back… I love him and I understand he has a strong sense of moral standards and integrity. As much criticism I received about my son, I would like to shed light on the fact – we all got bada** kids!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“They can’t seem like I’m the only one on here who got bada** kids,” he added.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Take a look at King’s response to Waka Flocka’s negligence above, as well as T.I. speaking on his parenting.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6l6qnnSqKVmo5mjtG60wKupoqtdncKzwIywmKSZXZu5sK%2FKmmSboaKptaWt2Gagp66ZqbJufZFsa3BvaWqDc3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./montell-jordan-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Montell Jordan Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
