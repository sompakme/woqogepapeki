How many times in your life have you said the words “I love this bra”? If your answer is anything above zero, then how many times did you actually, truly, genuinely mean it? Did you really love that bra, or did you just find it more tolerable than the rest? Even if you loved the design, how many times did it leave indents in your skin, have you pulling its straps back up or force you to readjust multiple times throughout the day?"><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

If your answer is anything above zero, then how many times did you actually, truly, genuinely mean it? Did you really love that bra, or did you just find it more tolerable than the rest? Even if you loved the design, how many times did it leave indents in your skin, have you pulling its straps back up or force you to readjust multiple times throughout the day?</p><p>Ugh. Bras. For some of us, we can’t live without them — but why does living with them have to be so difficult? Well, we can answer that. It doesn’t actually have to be. It’s not easy to find a bra you can legitimately love, but <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">it is possible</a>. Sometimes that means looking to others for inspiration. For Us, that inspiration came from <strong>Emily</strong> <strong>Ratajskowski</strong>, and the bra itself is available from Amazon!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Boody Body EcoWear Bamboo Shaper Bra</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$17</a> at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, October 26, 2020, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>Ratajkowski has posted multiple photos of herself wearing her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Boody bra</a> on Instagram, whether for a selfie in bed or for a quick pic while out and about in NYC. So what makes this ultra-affordable bra so good that even huge celebs like EmRata love it? Let’s start with the fabric itself, made of 80% organically-grown bamboo viscose. The bamboo is sustainably sourced, meaning this is “fashion you can feel good about,” plus, it’s cooling, breathable and gentle on sensitive skin. It’s also made to reduce static cling. Cotton bras and bralettes are shaking in their boots!</p><p>Bamboo aside, this bra continues to impress. It’s totally seamless and features no hooks, clasps, push-up padding or underwire. There is no metal to be detected here. It’s stretchy enough that you can just comfortably pull it on, and the straps will sit smoothly under clothes, ditching the rings and sliders!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Boody Body EcoWear Bamboo Shaper Bra</a> starting at just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$17</a> at Amazon!

The ribbing detail, perfectly placed to enhance your natural shape. On top of that, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this Boody bra</a> does offer light support, and it even claims to be moisture-wicking, which is a must either over the summer or in rooms where the heat is blasting, or even for bed if you’re a hot sleeper!</p><p>This bra is definitely earning the title of bra for the bra haters, and shoppers are catching on fast. They’re buying like mad, so you won’t want to wait on this. Whether you’re wearing it under your clothes or on its own with high-waisted denim a la Ratajkowski, you’re going to love having it in your life.
