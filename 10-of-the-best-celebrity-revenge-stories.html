When someone is wronged, they can take it one of two ways; they can be the bigger person and move on with their lives, or they can get revenge and make the other person pay. Almost everyone loves a story about a bad guy getting exactly what he or she deserves. ABC has proved this with its surprise hit show Revenge, which is currently on its fourth season. However, sometimes revenge stories don’t come out of a truly terrible situation. The revenge stories listed below come from a lover being scorned, a director being told that they made the wrong choice in casting, and authors who get revenge on their critics by giving the critic’s character a small penis in their book. These forms of revenge are creative, and they get right to the point. So for your entertainment, below is a list of ten of the most creative celebrity revenge stories.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-freaks-and-geeks-cast><strong>10.&nbsp;Freaks and Geeks&nbsp;Cast&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Although Freaks and Geeks now has a devoted cult following and has been named one of the, “100 Greatest Shows of All time,” by Time magazine, the show was once thought to be a giant flop. After airing just 12 episodes, NBC decided to cancel the show after consistently weak ratings. One of the harshest critiques that <a title="Judd Apatow Net Worth" href=#>Judd Apatow</a>, the executive producer of the show, received was that he had picked the wrong cast. Determined to prove NBC wrong, Apatow stuck with most of his original cast and turned them into success stories. Today, the original Freaks and Geeks cast members, <a title="Seth Rogen Net Worth" href=#>Seth Rogen</a>, <a title="Jason Segel Net Worth" href=#>Jason Segel</a> and <a title="James Franco Net Worth" href=#>James Franco</a>, are some of the biggest names in Hollywood.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=9-nicki-minaj><strong>9. Nicki Minaj&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>We can probably all agree that&nbsp;<a title="Nicki Minaj Net Worth" href=#>Nicki Minaj</a> is not the safest person to get into an argument with. After Minaj and her then boyfriend had an argument, things escalated rather quickly. The rapper grabbed a baseball bat, chased her boyfriend out of the house, and then beat her Mercedes that she let her boyfriend use sometimes. During that same fight, Minaj removed all of her boyfriend’s clothes from her house, and threw them in the trash. It looks like Nicki Minaj is not someone you want to mess with.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-the-small-penis-trick><strong>8. The Small Penis Trick&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>A lot of times, authors take the opportunity to put someone they don’t like into their work. This person is usually represented as a killer or a coward. The only problem with representing someone in a text is the possibility of being sued for libel. However, some authors have come up with a good way of getting around the libel charges. It’s called the “small penis rule,” Whenever a writer represents someone in their novel or story, they subtly hint that the character has a small penis. Because not many people want to go on record for being the inspiration behind a character with a small penis, the possibility for being sued is fairly low. <a title="Michael Crichton Net Worth" href=#>Michael Crichton</a> has used this trick in his book,&nbsp;State of Fear to depict an unfriendly critic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-naya-rivera><strong>7. Naya Rivera&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>There are some people who you want to avoid pissing off at all costs, and&nbsp;<a title="Naya Rivera Net Worth" href=#>Naya Rivera</a>&nbsp;just so happens to be&nbsp;one of those people. After the Glee star broke up with her boyfriend and fellow co-star, Mark Salling, things got pretty ugly. Apparently, all the time that Salling spent with other women made Rivera go a little nuts. In a jealous rage, Rivera and some of her friends reportedly threw eggs at Salling’s car and even poured dog food onto it. After the incident, work must have been pretty awkward.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-lord-byron><strong>6. Lord Byron&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Sometimes, being a step ahead of the person you are in disagreement with is the best way to get revenge, and that's exactly what Lord Byron reportedly did. Successful poet, Lord Byron was apparently a huge animal lover. So when Cambridge Trinity College told the poet that he wouldn't be able to take a dog with him on campus, Byron did the only next logical thing, he brought a bear instead. That's right, an actual bear. Although the University wasn't so keen on having a bear on their campus, there were technically no rules against it, so in other words, the bear was allowed to stay.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=5-reggie-bush><strong>5. Reggie Bush&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a title="Reggie Bush Net Worth" href=#>Reggie Bush</a> dated reality star <a title="Kim Kardashian Net Worth" href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>, from 2007-2010. But apparently, that wasn't enough for Bush. So after the couple parted ways, Bush started dating a Kim Kardashian look-alike, possibly hoping to get Kim jealous. The Kardashian look-alike looks so similar to the real Kardashian that Kim decided to sue Old Navy for using the look-alike in their ad campaign. However, Reggie’s actions might have been less about revenge and more about love. Reggie Bush and <a title="Melissa Molinaro Net Worth" href=#>Mellissa Molinaro</a> (the look-alike) married around the same time as Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-peter-james><strong>4. Peter James&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Peter James loves making characters out of people who have wronged or annoyed him. The author usually places these characters in deathly situations, where he takes his own form of literary revenge. One occasion in which James used this revenge trick was after a crazy fan and stalker harassed him, and even sent him a 10,000-word rant. The crazed fan apparently became the inspiration behind a character who murders a famous actress. We’re guessing that the crazed fan character didn't really get a happy ending.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=3-calvin-harris><strong>3. Calvin Harris&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>There were apparently some hard feelings after <a title="Calvin Harris Net Worth" href=#>Calvin Harris</a> and Rita Ora parted ways. After the couple split, Ora was supposed to perform her song, “I Will Never Let You Down,” at the Teen Choice Awards, however, Harris seemingly had other plans. Ora said, “For anybody who doesn't understand how it works, he wrote and produced the song. So he has to approve anything TV-wise for anybody who doesn't get it. And obviously, he owns the rights to it and he didn't approve the Teen Choice Awards.”&nbsp;In Harris' defense, maybe it wasn't out of revenge, but out of pain.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-peter-i><strong>2. Peter I</strong></h2><p>Peter I was a Prince in Portugal, who fell in love with a woman that his father did not approve of. The love affair was between the prince and Ines de Castro. Even though the pair were deeply in love, Peter’s father had already married him off to a daughter of a powerful ally. Still, the two managed to continue their love affair. When Peter’s wife died, the King refused to let Peter see his lover. To make sure that Peter followed his rules, the King ordered Ines’ assassination. At the time, Peter could do nothing, but when his father died, he decided to avenge his lover. Peter found the people who had executed Ines and killed them. In addition, Peter, who was now the King, told everybody that he had married Ines in secret before she died, making Ines the Queen consort of Portugal. Her body was then moved into the mausoleum of the palace.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=1-taylor-swift><strong>1. Taylor Swift&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Ahh, <a title="Taylor Swift Net Worth" href=#>Taylor Swift</a>, the one and only queen of getting revenge on her exes or people that have wronged her. Swift has written songs about nearly all of her exes, who include <a title="John Mayer Net Worth" href=#>John Mayer</a>, <a title="Joe Jonas Net Worth" href=#>Joe Jonas</a> and <a title="Taylor Lautner Net Worth" href=#>Taylor Lautner</a>&nbsp;(and probably a few more as well). One of Swift’s most brutal revenge songs is the song she wrote about actress <a title="Camilla Belle Net Worth" href=#>Camilla Belle</a>, who allegedly stole Joe Jonas from her. In the song are the lyrics, “She’s an actress, whoa…She’s better known for the things that she does on the mattress…” Sweet little Taylor was Harsh on this one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaF2ks27Ax55km52jqXqkscuemauhpK56s7HVnqWgnV2owbC%2ByJ6qaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-consultant-ending-explained-who-was-regus-patoff.html><span>←</span><span>The Consultant ending explained: Who was Regus Patoff?</span></a>
