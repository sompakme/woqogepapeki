The Presleys were deeply religious and regularly attended church, where they sang gospel music together.</p><p>Elvis was particularly close with his parents and brought them along for the ride as he rose to fame and fortune.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1957, when he purchased Graceland, his parents moved in with him and Vernon Presley managed his son’s <a href=#>business</a> affairs from an office on the property.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, Gladys passed away in 1958, and Elvis was deeply affected by her death. He was buried next to her the next day in an unmarked grave in Priceville Cemetery.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the challenges of his early life, Elvis’ family remained a constant source of support and inspiration throughout his career.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Elvis had three step-siblings</h2><p>A year after the passing of Elvis Presley’s mother, his father married a woman named Davida “<strong>Dee</strong>” Stanley in 1960.&nbsp;</p><p>Dee came with three sons from her previous marriage, Bill, David, and Rick Stanley. However, this marriage ended in divorce in November 1977.&nbsp;</p><p>As Elvis was considerably older than the three Stanley boys, he became something of a father figure to them. In later years, the Stanley brothers became part of the “<strong>Memphis Mafia</strong>,” acting as aides and confidants to Elvis.</p><p>In 2016, David Stanley published a memoir, “<strong>My Brother Elvis: The Final Years</strong>,” which details his time spent with Elvis in Graceland, including his role as the singer’s bodyguard and his account of Elvis’ drug usage and death.&nbsp;</p><p>Other published books include “<strong>Elvis, We Love You Tender</strong>” and “<strong>The Elvis Encyclopedia.</strong>“</p><p>In addition to the stepbrothers of Elvis Presley, Rick Stanley, and Bill Stanley, there is also a woman who has come forward claiming to be the illegitimate child of Vernon Presley, Elvis’ father.&nbsp;</p><p>This would make her Elvis’ half-sister. The woman, named Eliza, has had her DNA compared to one of Elvis’ paternal cousins, and the lab results indicated kinship.&nbsp;</p><p>She also had her DNA compared to a man claiming to be Elvis himself, and the results showed that she was that man’s half-sister.&nbsp;</p><p>A Cleveland <a href=#>news</a> station conducted further testing and verified the original results. Eliza has been trying to pursue this issue in the courts, but the case has now been dropped after evidence proved that she is unrelated to the Presleys.&nbsp;</p><p>It was earlier dismissed on jurisdictional grounds but Eliza was trying to find the funding to reopen the case in the correct court. It’s worth mentioning that, under her original name, Alice Elizabeth McFarland, Eliza has a long criminal history.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCxy6%2BgrGWgp7K0uMSyZKyhkqG2r7PSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cuba-gooding-jr-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Cuba Gooding Jr. Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
