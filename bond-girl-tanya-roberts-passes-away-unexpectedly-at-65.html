She was brilliant and beautiful and I feel like a light has been taken away. To say she was an angel would be at the top of the list. She was the sweetest person you’d ever meet and had a huge heart. She loved her fans, and I don’t think she realized how much she meant to them,” Mike Pingel, Roberts’ representative told The Hollywood Reporter.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Dawn Wells, Mary Ann on Gilligan's Island, Passes Away At 82" href=#>Dawn Wells, Mary Ann on Gilligan's Island, Passes Away At 82</a></span></p><p>Born in 1955 in the Bronx, New York City, Roberts was the second child of a father of Irish descent and a Jewish mother. At 15, she left high school and hitchhiked across the United States, before returning to New York City where she became a successful model. After marrying Barry Roberts, who was pursuing a career as a screenwriter, she began studying at the Actors Studio with Lee Strasberg and Uta Hagen under the name Tanya Roberts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her career began off-Broadway where she starred in productions of Picnic and Antigone. She made her film debut in the horror film Forced Entry in 1975, which was followed by the comedy film The Yum-Yum Girls in 1976. In 1980, she was selected from 2,000 candidates to replace Shelley Hack in the fifth season of Charlie's Angels.</p><p>On That ’70s Show, the actress played the hippie mom of Donna Pinciotti (<a href=#>Laura Prepon</a>). She left the show in 2001, before returning in 2004. Her final on-screen appearance was in the series Barbershop in 2005. Britt Ekland, who played a Bond girl in The Man With The Golden Gun, tweeted, “Rip Tanya Roberts, once a Bond Girl always a Bond Girl!”</p><p>Meanwhile, The Beastmaster director Don Coscarelli tweeted, “I just heard the sad news that actress Tanya Roberts passed away. Tanya was a beautiful person, inside and out. I will always remember Tanya for being incredibly sweet and for her genuine love of animals. She was beloved by Beastmaster fans everywhere.
