On Monday (Mar. 18), MGM released a statement addressing rumors Mars accumulated a massive <a href=# id=auto-tag_debt data-tag=debt>debt</a> with the casino.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">According to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Complex</a>, the gaming company released a statement refuting these murmurs. MGM detailed they were “proud” of their partnership with <a href=#>the Grammy award-winning artist</a>. The company stated that their relationship was one based on “mutual respect.” I don’t know; these words don’t sound like a company looking to collect an egregious debt.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“We’re proud of our relationship with Bruno Mars, one of the world’s most thrilling and dynamic performers,” their statement read. “From his shows at Dolby Live at Park MGM to the new Pinky Ring lounge at Bellagio, Bruno’s<a href=#> brand of entertainment attracts visitors</a> from around the globe. MGM and Bruno’s partnership is longstanding and rooted in mutual respect.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Any speculation otherwise is completely false; he has no debt with MGM. Together, we are excited to continue creating unforgettable experiences for our guests.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1405334766.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NewsNation</a>&nbsp;first reported that Bruno had accumulated a $50 gambling debt at the Las Vegas establishment. The report stated that Mars, 38, had been enjoying his Vegas residency a bit too much. Multiple sources detailed that the musician “owes millions to the MGM (from gambling).”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“He makes $90 million a year off of the deal he did with the casino, but then he has to pay back his debt… after taxes (Mars makes $1.5 million per night),” the source said.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Bruno Mars originally inked a long-term residency contract with the resort in 2016. Additionally, the partnership saw Mars and MGM debut a new attraction and lounge, The Pinky Ring, inside the Bellagio Hotel and Casino. The Pinky Ring cocktail bar debuted during the 2024 Super Bowl weekend. The lounge features live performances curated by Bruno, himself.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1389410966.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“<a href=#>Bruno is among the most talented performers</a> in the world and we are excited to start a long-term relationship with him across our industry-leading portfolio of entertainment venues,” Bill Hornbuckle, president of MGM Resorts International,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>said</a>&nbsp;at the time. “There is no stronger launching pad for a new venue than for Bruno Mars to be among the first to grace its stage, and we get to do it twice, an amazing beginning to a multi-year partnership.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">And while the rumors of Mars owing his life to MGM Grand is (seemingly) untrue, he has previously gushed about gambling before. In 2013, the artist spoke to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GQ</a>&nbsp;about his love for the vice. He recalled and pined for the old days when he used to gamble in Los Angeles after being introduced to the lifestyle at 19.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I used to be like a loudmouth. You know the guy, people would want to take his money. If you do get them to lose, they’re out for you, they’re gunning for you,” Mars said at the time. “And that’s when they’re weak. And that’s when you jump or pounce on them. I remember my first bet, my hand was shaking, and a guy called me out on it and embarrassed me. [But] you gotta lose. You just have to lose to win, to understand.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-1389381752.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6K0rnnGq5innF2Zsq%2B1xKxkq62dpL%2B0ecGrrKenXaKus7%2BMnJisoZ6keqWxwa1kampjaYV3fpBxb2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marion-jones-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Marion Jones Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
