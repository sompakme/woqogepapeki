But beyond his massive success on the court, Barkley is also renowned for his candid and often controversial candor as a sports analyst, as well as in his own interviews.</p><p>While devoted followers of Barkley are sure to know, the 6' 6" giant is also an avid golfer and one-time friend of golfing legend <strong><a href=#>Tiger Woods</a></strong>. The two were close for many years, bonding over their love of golf and shared experiences as famed professional athletes.</p><p>But what happened that caused the end of their friendship? Well, that was revealed during Barkley's explosive sit-down interview on the In Depth show with Graham Besignger.</p><h2 id=charles-barkley-revealed-why-he-and-tiger-woods-are-no-longer-friends>Charles Barkley Revealed Why He And Tiger Woods Are No Longer Friends</h2><p><strong>Charles Barkley and Tiger Woods became friends</strong> alongside legendary basketball player <strong>Michael Jordan</strong> in the mid-1990s, which was during the height of the trio's fame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Barkley and Woods reportedly were introduced by baseball icon <strong>Derek Jeter</strong>. Not soon after, Barkley and Woods were often spotted alongside Jordan on the green playing golf. They were also frequently pictured courtside at basketball games and other sporting events.</p><p>However, after reportedly over ten years of friendship between B<strong>arkley and Woods, the two suddenly fell out</strong>. And when their friendship ended, no one in the media had any idea what happened until 2014.

He added that <strong>he loved Woods like a brother </strong>and wished him nothing but the best.</p><p>Barkley then delved deeper and shared that he believed when all the bad stuff had happened in Tiger Woods's life, the latter suddenly went in a different direction. The basketball phenom stated again that he wanted nothing but the best for Woods before lamenting their friendship of many years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/espn-still-showed-sympathy-towards-tiger-woods-in-the-midst-of-his-scandal-banning-footage-from-their-network-that-was-initially-shown.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Barkley then shocked the show's host by mentioning that he thought Woods' back injury might be best for him. When asked why? Barkley answered that he believed Woods had returned to golfing soon. He added that now Woods didn't have to worry about the PGA or the Ryder Cup.</p><p>Barkley then insinuated that <strong>Tiger Woods's back injury</strong> would give his old friend the break he needed before the next season. He added he could now take much-needed time to heal in rehab and not have to rush back.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/charles-barkley-s-friendship-with-tiger-woods-came-crashing-down-after-these-comments-front-back-deposit.jpg><p>Charles Barkley then went a step further and stated there was no doubt that <strong>Woods ran back to be in the British Open</strong> too soon, was trying to win the<strong> PGA</strong>, and likely wanted to make the <strong>Ryder Cup</strong> team.

He reminded the host that Woods had had significant injuries throughout his golfing career and was digging the golf club in the ground.</p><p>Charles Barkley added that one's body, at some point, is bound to give in and that he hoped Woods' rehab went well and that he would come back stronger.</p><h2 id=charles-barkley-blamed-tiger-woods-39-s-divorce-with-elin-nordegren-for-their-feud>Charles Barkley Blamed Tiger Woods's Divorce With Elin Nordegren For Their Feud</h2><p>In 2009, the same year his friendships with Charles Barkley and later Michael Jordan dissolved, Tiger Woods suffered the biggest setback in his personal and professional life.</p><p>That was when the press got wind that <strong>Woods had been cheating on his wife</strong>, former nanny <strong>Elin Nordegren</strong>, with dozens of women throughout the length of their marriage.

After that … thing, he just stopped talking to us [Barkley and Jordan]. That's all I know. I could understand if he was trying to get back with his wife at the time and she said, 'Hey, get rid of all your old friends,' and he called and said, 'This is the situation...I would've understood that.
