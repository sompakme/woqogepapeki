The exes share 18-year-old Sami and 17-year-old Lola. (The Wild Things star adopted daughter Eloise in 2011. Sheen, for his part, is the father to 12-year-old twins Bob and Max, whom he shares with ex-wife Brooke Mueller.)</p><p>While both girls previously lived with the Illinois native, things took a turn when in September 2021 Sami claimed via TikTok that she was “trapped in an abusive home” while <a href=#>living with her mom</a> and husband <a href=#><strong>Aaron Phypers</strong></a>.</p><p>“Now: finally moved out of the hell house, had a spiritual awakening, own 2 cats, happy single, full of self love, and dropped out of high school :),” Sami said on the social media platform. Sheen confirmed later that month that his eldest had moved in with him and was getting her GED.</p><p>“I love her and all my children unconditionally. We’re having a ball. GED here we come!” he said via his publicist.</p><p>A source exclusively told Us Weekly at the time that Richards was “saddened” <a href=#>by the situation</a>, but “very much loves her daughter.”</p><p>The two <a href=#>reconnected to celebrate</a> Mother’s Day in May when Sami revealed a glimpse into the pair’s reunion.</p><p>“Happy mother’s day !! i love u so much mom. u have no idea how grateful i am to have u in my life 💗💐🥂,” Richards’ eldest daughter captioned via Instagram selfies.</p><p>Richards commented on the post, writing, “Thank you Sami for an amazing Mother’s Day. It means a lot to me.
