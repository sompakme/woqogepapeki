Cardi tagged Versace’s official Instagram account as well as those belonging to Donatella Versace and her sister Hennessey. She also used the hashtag #versacelamedusamini.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cardi B and Hennessey aren’t the only famous sisters representing Versace’s new collection. Dua Lipa also shared photos on her social media accounts modelling the designer’s clothes and accessories with her younger sister Rina.</p><p>The photos shows Dua in a red dress holding a La Medusa Mini in yellow. Her sister matches in a black dress with rainbow detailing while holding up a blue version of the bag.</p><p>La Medusa is the newest style of purse launched by Versace and <a href=#>ranges in price from $1,450 to $3,850.</a> It comes in a variety of styles, colors, and sizes, including a miniature version and a large tote bag style. Each of the bags comes with&nbsp;the classic Versace medusa symbol alongside gold hardware.</p><p>As per <a href=#>W Magazine</a>, Versace has been pushing a sisterhood theme since January ahead of the collection’s launch. The outlet speculates it may have something to do with the tragic story of Donatella Versace’s sister, who passed away at the age of 12 after contracting tetanus.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Earlier this year, supermodel sisters <a href=#>Gigi and Bella Hadid</a> were the face of the Versace campaign. The fashion house shared various images of the sisters on their official Instagram page to tease the new collection, especially the Medusa bags.</p><p>Versace was first founded in Milan, Italy in 1978 by Gianni Versace. The late designed chose Medusa as the logo for the brand because he was enthralled by the hold the fictional creature had over people and wanted his designs to have a similar effect on the target audience.</p><p>Nowadays, the brand is known for its garish prints and bold colors yet undeniable elegance. According to <a href=#>MD Daily Record</a>, Versace is currently worth approximately $5 billion, and that stands to increase if the new collection is a success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Jussie Smollett Sentenced To Jail, Must Pay $120,000 For Faking Hate Crime</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>MD Daily Record</a>, <a href=#>W Magazine</a>, <a href=#>Versace</a>, <a href=#>Instagram @iamcardib</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9WeqayZk5p6tLzRoqWgZaOquq6x0WaamqWglraouoycnKWdkqe2tcWMrKCsrJWnwG6vwKubomWSYrWmus2eqqydqWKxtq2MpaCpmV2ctqi1jJucpaSRYrWisMidZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-socha-is-lauren-socha-s-older-brother-and-her-biggest-fan.html><span>←</span><span>Michael Socha Is Lauren Sochas Older Brother and Her Biggest Fan</span></a>
