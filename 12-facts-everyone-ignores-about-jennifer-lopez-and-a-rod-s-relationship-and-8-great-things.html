However, if you're not into baseball, his name&nbsp;might&nbsp;not be that familiar to you. Even people who know nothing about baseball caught wind of his name around 2017 because he hit a home run with&nbsp;J.Lo during that year. The former New York Yankee was a favorite among baseball fans, but maybe not with J.Lo’s former husband, who probably always rooted for the opposing team.</p><p>There are so many ignored things about&nbsp;J.Lo and A-Rod’s relationship. And (of course) a few awesome ones that make them the most adorable couple.</p><h2 id=everyone-ignores---they-met-while-in-different-marriages><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>Everyone Ignores - They Met While In Different Marriages</span></h2><p>J.Lo’s first look at Alex Rodriguez was when she and her then-husband, Marc Anthony, went out for a baseball game. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Sports Illustrated</a>, this was back in 2005, at the Shea Stadium in Queens, New York. A-Rod was also married then, to Cynthia Scurtis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=everyone-ignores---a-rod-could-not-recognize-jennifer-while-he-was-out-for-lunch><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Everyone Ignores - A-Rod Could Not Recognize Jennifer While He Was Out for Lunch</span></h2><p>Alex and Jennifer first met in 2005, but it took 12 years before they reconnected. And, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Vanity Fair</a>,&nbsp;J.Lo spotted Rodriguez in a restaurant while having lunch. She had to reintroduce herself with “It’s Jennifer” before it finally clicked in A-Rod's mind who he was staring at.</p><h2 id=everyone-ignores---a-rod-thought-the-first-real-date-was-just-a-casual-friends-date><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Everyone Ignores - A-Rod Thought The First Real Date Was Just A Casual Friends Date</span></h2><p>A-Rod had the first date nerves,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Vanity Fair</a>, and he wasn’t even sure if the first date was a real date. He thought they were just friends hanging out at night, due to J.Lo's hectic work schedule. Turns out he was wrong.</p><h2 id=everyone-ignores---they-are-not-married-but-have-moved-in-together><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Everyone Ignores - They Are Not Married But Have Moved in Together</span></h2><p>Everyone’s waiting for the day&nbsp;J.Lo will walk down the aisle and marry Alex Rodriguez. Before that happens, we might have to wait a bit longer. Alex and Jennifer are already living together, so maybe they're in no rush to wed. They purchased an apartment worth $15.3 million, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Street Easy</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=everyone-ignores---lopez-did-not-notice-a-rod-and-hunter-cheating-scandal><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Everyone Ignores - Lopez Did Not Notice A-Rod And Hunter Cheating Scandal</span></h2><p>A-Rod might have possibly been 'double dating' Lopez and fitness model, Lauren Hunter. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to the National Enquirer</a>, A-Rod and Lauren started dating back in 2011, and even after&nbsp;J.Lo and A-Rod hooked up in 2017, they were still sending naughty text messages to each other.</p><h2 id=everyone-ignores---a-rod-told-his-friends-about-his-admiration-for-lopez><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Everyone Ignores - A-Rod Told His Friends About His Admiration For Lopez</span></h2><p>Well,&nbsp;J.Lo is not A-Rod’s first celebrity catch. The former pro baseball player has dated many female celebrities, one of them being Kate Hudson. But, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to People Magazine</a>, his friends claim that&nbsp;J.Lo was A-Rod’s dream catch. He was always taken by her personality and beauty.</p><h2 id=everyone-ignores---marc-anthony-and-a-rod-chipped-in-with-contributions-for-her-disaster-relief-concert><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Everyone Ignores - Marc Anthony and A-Rod Chipped in With Contributions for Her Disaster Relief Concert</span></h2><p>After Hurricane Irma devastated most parts of Puerto Rico in 2017,&nbsp;J.Lo hosted a Disaster Relief concert to help the victims.

They are both Leos, they are both of Latino descent, they both hail from New York, etc. They have about “20 other things” in common.</p><h2 id=everyone-ignores---their-first-meet-up-was-captured-on-camera><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Everyone Ignores - Their First Meet Up Was Captured On Camera</span></h2><p>Believe it or not, a cameraman caught the two shaking hands for the first time in 2005. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Sports Illustrated</a>, J.Lo was in the company of her then-husband, Marc Anthony, watching a baseball match at Shea Queens Stadium in New York.&nbsp;J.Lo claims to have had a jolt of electricity rush through her for about 3 to 5 seconds while she was holding A-Rod’s hand.</p><h2 id=everyone-ignores---the-first-real-date-was-cut-by-an-evacuation-process-after-a-fire-alarm-went-off><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Everyone Ignores - The First Real Date Was Cut By An Evacuation Process After&nbsp;A Fire Alarm Went Off</span></h2><p>Alex Rodriguez couldn’t avoid the first date nerves. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Vanity Fair</a>, Alex was unsure he was on a date until, later on in the night,&nbsp;J.Lo mentioned she was single. He immediately headed for the bathroom to collect his thoughts. As he was making his grand entrance back to their table (and sending a sexy text message to J.Lo), the fire alarm went off and they had to be evacuated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=everyone-ignores---lopez-is-not-lucky-with-love-matters><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Everyone Ignores - Lopez Is Not Lucky With Love Matters</span></h2><p>J.Lo’s love life has been a rocky one. Despite having a strong belief in marriage,&nbsp;J.Lo has suffered numerous heartaches and divorces. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Nicki Swift</a>, one of her marriages didn’t last even one year. Her longest marriage was with singer, Marc Anthony. She has two kids with Marc. They're twins named Emme and Max.</p><h2 id=everyone-ignores---lopez-went-public-about-dating-with-an-instagram-story-that-she-quickly-pulled-down><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Everyone Ignores - Lopez Went Public About Dating With An Instagram Story That She Quickly Pulled Down</span></h2><p>In March of 2017,&nbsp;J.Lo decided to pull the cat out of the bag and unleash her romance with Rodriguez to the world through an Instagram Story. However, that post was quickly pulled down. Fast forward to April 2017, when an unashamed&nbsp;J.Lo posted a picture of her and A-Rod watching baseball <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">to Instagram</a>, throwing Hollywood into a tizzy.</p><h2 id=great-thing---together-they-helped-raise-35-million-for-disaster-aid><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Great Thing - Together, They Helped Raise $35 Million For Disaster Aid</span></h2><p>Hurricane Irma was very devastating for Puerto Ricans.

He even teases the reporter by asking if the reporter can arrange a date between him and Jennifer Lopez.</p><h2 id=great-thing---lopez-dedicated-the-song-us-to-a-rod-while-performing-at-a-pre-super-bowl-show><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Great Thing - Lopez Dedicated The Song ‘Us’ To A-Rod While Performing At A Pre-Super Bowl Show</span></h2><p>J.Lo decided to turn the attention of a pre-Super Bowl show audience towards her bae, A-Rod, by dedicating the song, “Us”, to him. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Yahoo</a>, she made the performance more special by wearing a New York Yankee’s jersey (and cap) bearing A-Rod’s number.</p><h2 id=great-thing---lopez-throws-hints-of-a-ring-in-the-song-el-anillo><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Great Thing - Lopez Throws Hints Of ‘A Ring’ In The Song ‘El Anillo’</span></h2><p>There’s a lot that you can capture about J.Lo’s love life by listening to the lyrics of her love songs.

This song was dedicated to A-Rod in 2018.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=great-thing---almost-celebrating-the-3rd-anniversary-on-february-3rd-2020><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Great Thing - Almost Celebrating the 3rd Anniversary on February 3rd, 2020</span></h2><p>Every Valentine’s month is a special month for Alex and Jennifer.
