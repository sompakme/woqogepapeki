She ultimately died <a href=#>as a result of her injuries</a>. The outlet has since confirmed that the Independent Office for Police Conduct is investigating the crash.</p><p>In a statement, Helen’s son, <strong>Martin Holland</strong>, told <a href=#>BBC</a> on Wednesday that his mother passed away after “suffering multiple broken bones and massive internal injuries.” He added that Helen fought “for her life for nearly two weeks” but the “irreversible damage to her brain finally ended the battle today.”</p><p>Following Helen’s death, the head of the Metropolitan Police’s Royalty and Specialist Protection Unit addressed the tragic incident.</p><p>“Officers know that their actions, both on and off duty, are open to scrutiny and following our referral of the incident, the IOPC launched an independent investigation,” Chief Superintendent <strong>Richard Smith</strong> said in a statement to BBC. “We continue to co-operate with and support that inquiry.”</p><p>Sophie, 58, for her part, will be reaching out to the Holland family personally, according to <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>. The royal <a href=#>previously said she was praying for Helen</a> when she was initially taken to the hospital following the accident.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“The Duchess’s heartfelt thoughts and prayers are with the injured lady and her family. She is grateful for the swift response by the emergency services and will keep abreast of developments,” the May 11 statement read. “Further comment at this time would not be appropriate while the incident is being investigated.”</p><p>A similar incident occurred in June 2019 when pedestrian <strong>Irene Mayor</strong> was hit by a police motorcycle in <a href=#><strong>Prince William</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Princess Kate</strong></a>’s escort.</p><p>“The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were deeply concerned and saddened to hear about the accident on Monday afternoon,” a spokesperson for Kensington Palace said in a statement at the time. “Their Royal Highnesses have sent their very best wishes to Irene and her family and will stay in touch throughout every stage of her recovery.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadrZOdsrS%2FjKymqaCZmnqjvsSaoqxlo565prrCnmSanqSav268zqWgnJ1dmsCku9GtZKShnKGypXnEpZueqpyueri7zJqlaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./did-they-bleach-tom-felton-s-hair-was-tom-felton-s-hair-real-in-harry-potter.html><span>←</span><span>Did they bleach Tom Feltons hair?
