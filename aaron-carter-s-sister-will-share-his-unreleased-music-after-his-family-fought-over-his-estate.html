His mother, Jane Carter, confirmed to TMZ that they weren’t challenging Prince’s right to inherit what was left of Carter’s net worth.</p><p>Jane Carter also said she hoped to have a relationship with Prince one day, suggesting she’s estranged from Melanie. Aaron had an infamously tumultuous relationship with his family, even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">making abuse allegations against his older brother and sister</a>. His brother, Nick Carter, took out a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">restraining order against Aaron</a> after the pop star made threats against Nick’s then-pregnant wife.
