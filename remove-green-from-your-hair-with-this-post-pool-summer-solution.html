When it comes to the environment, we love going green. But when it comes to our hair, we would prefer to stick with our natural color!

But when it comes to our hair, we would prefer to stick with our natural color! Unfortunately, summer pool days can become bad hair days if we soak in the water for too long. Contrary to popular belief, chlorine is not the main culprit here. In fact, copper is the ingredient that tends to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">turn hair green in the pool</a>. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TODAY</a>, chlorine oxidizes hard metals found in pool water, making our hair look like we just got slimed at the Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards. This swimmer’s effect is more noticeable on blondes, but any hair color can experience unwanted green tint.</p><p>We finally found a simple solution to tackle copper build-up! <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Malibu C Swimmers Wellness Collection</a>. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Allure</a> specifically recommends Malibu C’s “gentle shampoos and conditioners” for hair exposed to pool water. These products protect against chlorine and copper sulfates, removing harsh elements of pool and ocean water to keep hair healthy. The shampoo and conditioner also soothe dryness and itchiness, restoring your scalp’s softness and shine.
