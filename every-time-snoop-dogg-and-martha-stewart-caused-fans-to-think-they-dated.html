Nearly 15 years later, the BFF duo is still going strong, prompting some to wonder whether their relationship has ever turned romantic, or ever will.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The answer is no: Stewart and Dogg have never dated. The rapper has been married to <a href=#>his teenage sweetheart Shante Broadus</a> since 1997, while Martha Stewart married publisher Andrew Stewart in 1961, before ultimately getting divorced in 1990. She has never remarried.</p><p>Despite being just pals, there have been some instances that led to speculations about a possible romance, confusing some fans who would like for their relationship to be more than just a friendship. Let's have a look.</p><h2 id=snoop-dogg-and-martha-stewart-proved-they-have-amazing-chemistry><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Snoop Dogg And Martha Stewart Proved They Have Amazing Chemistry</span></h2><p>In 2008, Snoop Dogg appeared on 'The Martha Stewart Show,' where they made mashed potatoes together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In between some spud squishing and mixing, the duo shared a nice conversation and gave proof of their great chemistry and banter in front ot the cameras as Stewart asked questions about Dogg's slang.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Martha Stewart Had This Surprising Career Before Domestic Diva Fame</a></span></p><p>Enough to assume something more was going on behind the scenes? For some, maybe, but the relationship seemed to be purely platonic.</p><p>Snoop, at this point almost a star of daytime television thanks to Stewart, went back to her show in 2009, when the duo made brownies, with the rapper alluding to adding marijuana and Stewart playing along.</p><h2 id=martha-stewart-said-she-wanted-to-see-more-of-snoop-dogg><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Martha Stewart Said She Wanted To See More Of Snoop Dogg</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Snoop's two guest appearances, his relationship with Martha was on hold for a while. In 2014, Stewart revealed i<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">n a Q&A session on Reddit</a> that she would love to be better friends with the rapper.</p><p>"I wish I were closer friends with Snoop Dogg," the host replied to a fan asking about their bond.</p><p>Needless to say, many of the questions she received on Reddit were about her relationship to Snoop Dogg, proving that some people were curious about it and not at all convinced that nothing romantic was going on.</p><p>"I've never tasted Snoop's cookies, so I don't know," Stewart also said when a person asked if she's ever tasted the rapper's special cookies, alluding to marijuana.</p><p>At the end of the session, Stewart updated her thread on Reddit with a direct message to Snoop.</p><p>"Where's Snoop? I have brownies FOR YOU!" she wrote.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=martha-stewart-and-snoop-dogg-reunited-to-roast-justin-bieber-and-sparks-flew><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Martha Stewart And Snoop Dogg Reunited To Roast Justin Bieber And Sparks Flew</span></h2><p>It wasn't long before the pair reunited on screen. In 2015, Martha and Snoop were back together on 'The Roast of Justin Bieber' on Comedy Central.</p><p>The two of them sat next to each another on stage and laughed at their respective jokes and roasts, proving once again how much fun they have together. Years later, Snoop revealed Martha's sass displayed on the night was the reason he wanted to spend as much time as possible with her.</p><p>"I knew I wanted to be alongside this lady for the rest of my life," the rapper said in 2019 (around the 1:25 minute mark in the video above).</p><h2 id=snoop-has-said-some-really-nice-things-about-martha><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Snoop Has Said Some Really Nice Things About Martha</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Snoop Dogg has always had nothing but kind, genuine words about Stewart. In an interview with 'Rolling Stone' in 2016, the rapper was filming its first show with the homemaker, 'Martha and Snoop’s Dinner Party' on VH1, in which they hosted various celebrity guests and went back to where it all started years prior: a shiny kitchen.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>A Timeline Of Snoop Dogg's Acting Career</a></span></p><p>"I've never met anyone like Martha Stewart," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dogg said of Martha at the time</a>.</p><p>"When we come together, it’s a natural combination of love, peace, and harmony," he continued.</p><h2 id=martha-and-snoop-shot-a-romantic-39-ghost-39-inspired-promo-for-their-show><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Martha And Snoop Shot A Romantic, 'Ghost' Inspired Promo For Their Show</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When promoting 'Martha and Snoop’s Dinner Party', the two celebrities went all the way and played with how the public perceived them as a maybe couple.</p><p>The promo for their cooking show is inspired by the romantic tearjerker movie 'Ghost,' with Martha and Snoop recreating the ultra-famous pottery scene where Demi Moore's character is molding a vase together with the ghost of her deceased boyfriend, played by Patrick Swayze.</p><p>Except here, Martha unbuttons her collared shirt and starts frosting a chocolate cake as it spins on a platter. That's when Snoop comes in, sporting a white tank top and a bandana, and sits behind her as they continue frosting together. Martha even lets Snoop lick frosting off her fingers!</p><h2 id=martha-and-snoop-shot-another-romantic-promo-as-jack-and-rose-from-39-titanic-39><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Martha And Snoop Shot *Another* Romantic Promo As Jack And Rose From 'Titanic'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2019, Snoop and Martha were gearing up for the season three premiere of their 'Potluck Dinner Party' series.</p><p>To amp up the hype for their cooking show, the two hosts and friends fully embraced the romance rumors and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reenacted the iconic 'Titanic' scene</a> where Jack and Rose are on the bow of the ship.</p><p>In the clip, Martha stars as Jack and Snoop as Rose, while potatoes play once again a crucial role. Not mashed this time around, but fried, as Snoop declared in a spoof line of the original scene: "I'm frying," he says as he holds two french fry baskets in hand — and the result is hilarious.</p><h2 id=martha-wrote-the-foreword-of-snoop-39-s-first-cookbook><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Martha Wrote The Foreword Of Snoop's First Cookbook</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Martha has always been supportive of Snoop, having nothing but praise to spare when the rapper released his first-ever cookbook in 2018 (of which she wrote the foreword, of course).
