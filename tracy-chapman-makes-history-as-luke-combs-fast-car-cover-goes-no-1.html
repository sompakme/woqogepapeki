It was the first single from her<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234745525> eponymous debut album</a> from 1988 and spent 21 weeks on the chart.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The LP earned her one of three gramophones at the 1989 GRAMMYs. Chapman went home having won Best Contemporary Folk Album, Best Female Vocal Performance for “Fast Car,” and Best New Artist. “Fast Car” was also nominated for record and <a href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1234727833>song of the year,</a> while&nbsp;the album&nbsp;received an Album Of The Year nod.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Billboard reported that Combs’ cover of <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234756936>“Fast Car” </a>has garnered at least $500,000 in international publishing royalties with most of those profits going to Chapman, who owns the writers’ and publishers’ share of the record. Luminate adds that streams of the original have increased by 44 percent since the newest cover debuted.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Combs selected this classic to cover after hearing it during a car ride with his father. “That was one of the first songs really that I ever remember hearing, listening to, loving. It’s just always been one of my favorite songs for my entire life,” he recalled to <a rel=nofollow href=#>iHeartCountry</a>. Previously, the likes of Khalid, Justin Bieber, Sam Smith, and more have all infamously covered the tune.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6m%2Foq%2FYZpqhmaCirq95xZqqrWWTlr9uuNSknGabn6KvtHnCqK2eql1mf3SAlnBnbW9gZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-valley-stars-jesse-lally-and-michelle-lally-have-separated.html><span>←</span><span>The Valley Stars Jesse Lally and Michelle Lally Have Separated</span></a>
