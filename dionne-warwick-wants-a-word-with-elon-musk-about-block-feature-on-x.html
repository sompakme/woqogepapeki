Warwick hilariously responded, “If you approach it that way you might go to jail. Be careful.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Another time she tweeted Lil Yachty asking him, “What was the thought process behind your name, @lilyachty? How did you go from Miles to that? Thanks!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>What was the thought process behind your name, <a href=# rel=nofollow>@lilyachty</a>?

The new change would be just one of many that he’s made already, including changing the platform’s name to X.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Musk has also <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234769548>discussed taking away feature</a>s that could potentially harm others with hate speech and more. In December, Warwick also spoke on his ideas about freedom of speech.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She <a href=# rel=nofollow>told PEOPLE</a>, “His attitude is freedom of speech, which is mine as well. However, there’s a&nbsp;way&nbsp;to do it. That’s one of the conversations I’m going to have with him. What is your true intent? I understand your freedom of speech attitude but how are you going to contain it, so it does not get out of hand?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1395371342.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Other celebrities have <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234711235>voiced their opinions</a> about Musk’s drastic changes to the app, which also included revoking legacy verification badges for celebrities.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I’m shocked and appalled at some of the ‘free speech’ I’ve seen on this platform since its acquisition,” award-winning singer Toni Braxton wrote at the time. “Hate speech under the veil of ‘free speech’ is unacceptable; therefore I am choosing to stay off Twitter as it is no longer a safe space for myself, my sons and other POC.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Since then, she’s yet to return.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I'm shocked and appalled at some of the "free speech" I've seen on this platform since its acquisition.
