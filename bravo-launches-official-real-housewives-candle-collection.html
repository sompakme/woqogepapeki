Plus, a BravoCon exclusive candle — Pinot Grigio.</p><p>“We are thrilled to partner with Literie for this exciting collaboration, inviting Bravo superfans to enjoy candles inspired by iconic Housewife moments,” <strong>Ellen Stone</strong>, EVP, Consumer Engagement & Brand Strategy, NBCUniversal Cable told Us Weekly in a statement on Monday, October 10. “This collection celebrates the franchise and it’s cemented cornerstone in the pop-culture zeitgeist, allowing fans to relive memorable moments paired with custom scents.”</p><p>Literie founder <strong>Erica Werber</strong> added: “Literie was inspired by preserving the best parts of New York City during the COVID-19 lockdown with lighthearted and thoughtful candles. With New York City being a flagship location of the Real Housewives franchise, partnering with Bravo to preserve iconic moments from the shows in the same manner was a natural fit.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The candles, which are $45, will officially launch at BravoCon and be available at the Bravo Bazaar.
