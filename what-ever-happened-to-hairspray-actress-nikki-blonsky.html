The actress held roles in a number of projects, including 'Geography Club', and 'The English Teacher', however, fans have not seen much of Nikki since. While she may have had her moment in 2007, was that it for Nikki Blonsky? Let's find out!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Queen Latifah's 'Queen Collective' Is Entering Season 2 Celebrating Diversity In Women Filmmakers</a></span></p><h2 id=nikki-blonsky-where-is-she-now>Nikki Blonsky, Where Is She Now?</h2><p>Nikki Blonsky gained nationwide notoriety after she landed the role of Tracy Turnblad in the hit film, 'Hairspray'. This movie musical marked one of the biggest ensemble casts in quite some time, starring major names such as Queen Latifah, Zac Efron, James Marsden, John Travolta, and Michelle Pfeiffer, to name a few. Nikki was cast as the film's lead, and it was all thanks to her singing and dancing skills. While Ricky Lake will always be the original Tracy Turnblad, Blonksy certainly gave the Broadway star a run for her money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The star later became a household name in the years following her success in 'Hairspray', however, it seems as if Nikki Blonsky has since fallen off the face of the earth, sparking many fans to wonder, whatever happened to her? Well, Nikki continued her efforts when it comes to acting, appearing in a handful of productions, including, 'Geography Club', and 'The English Teacher', however, things slowed down for Blonksy afterward. In 2011, the star revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was working as a makeup artist</a>. "It's true! I'm working as a makeup artist. I am proud to be working and helping pay bills, but I'll never lose sight of my dreams", she tweeted.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Celebs Who Tried & Failed At Having Music Careers</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the same year, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nikki was spotted working at a fashion boutique</a>, however, she brushed off those rumors claiming that she was experimenting at a friend's store to see what it was like for a day. Blonsky's boss at the time was singing another tune, claiming the actress did, in fact, work at the boutique anywhere between 2 to 3 times per week. While she has since stepped back from the limelight, Nikki found herself ready for the stage yet again in 2017.</p><p>The star was set to appear in the Off-Broadway production of 'Stuffed', however, she had to withdraw after falling ill during the rehearsal stage of the show. While we have yet to hear or see anything from Nikki Blonsky since, the star is happily selling videos of herself on Cameo, where you can purchase a video message from Nikki, which would make for the perfect gift for any die-hard 'Hairspray' fan.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here’s Why Zac Efron Didn’t Expect To Make It In Hollywood</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrK3sdFmn5qooJq7prCMraZmoJGev7S80ZqwZpmTqb%2Bmv9JmpaKjm556o7jOp6qksV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./us-weekly-s-hot-and-not-list-for-2024-according-to-celebs.html><span>←</span><span>Us Weeklys Hot and Not List for 2024, According to Celebs</span></a>
