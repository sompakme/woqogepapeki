It’s not all flawless faces and perfect complexions in Hollywood, contrary to popular belief. But the main difference between the average person and an A-lister is access to the best dermatologists and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">beauty products that can zap zits overnight</a>.</p><p>Celeb-approved skincare can cost a pretty penny, but <strong>Justin Bieber </strong>just introduced Us to one acne treatment that won’t break the bank. The “Sorry” singer has been rocking these <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">star-shaped pimple patches</a> recently, even sporting the stickers to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Billie Eilish</strong>’s birthday party</a> — power move. Cementing his seal of approval, Bieber posted a selfie on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram Stories</a> earlier this month with the caption: “Got a facial and I think my face is purging, lucky for these starface pimple patches.” It’s giving <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Olivia Rodrigo </strong>album cover</a> meets&nbsp;<strong>Lisa Frank</strong>.</p><p>Now you can purchase these exact pimple patches from Amazon! <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Part body art and part spot treatment</a>, these colorful stickers are officially this season’s must-have accessory.

Who knew getting rid of pimples could be so fun? But don’t let these multi-colored stars deceive you — they’re packed with hydrocolloid, an ingredient that reduces the appearance of acne. These star stickers absorb fluid, reduce redness and shrink spots! Plus, these pimple patches are oil-free, vegan and gentle on skin.</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Starface Party Pack BIG PACK Hydro-Stars</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$27</a> at Amazon!

As one shopper said, “It takes a bad situation, acne, and provides a way to heal it, but doesn’t make you feel like you need to hide it or pretend it isn’t there. These patches do more than just cover a zit. They also absorb any fluid discharge (eww) and reduce and calm any inflammation. I have been so impressed with how well they stick to clean, dry skin throughout the night, and they never feel stiff or uncomfortable. I totally forget I’m wearing them…until I see myself in the mirror looking like I’m ready for a party! Whoo-hoo!” Another customer gushed, “These are the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cutest acne patches EVER</a>. It makes me feel better about having acne tbh because it’s like you get a star for whatever you accomplished that day, no matter how small. I truly do love these things! They always minimize the appearance of blemishes fast. I also love that they stay stuck to your face. Even if I wear them to bed, they don’t fall off. Highly recommend!”</p><p>Shine like a star (literally) with these <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">star-shaped pimple patches from Starface</a>!</p><p><strong>See It!
