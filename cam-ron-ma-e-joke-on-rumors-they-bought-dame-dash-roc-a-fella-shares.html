Cam and Ma$e began laughing almost immediately like two school kids. Amid the laughter, Murda Ma$e began to pose a “hypothetical” angle to the question.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He ran through some alleged numbers and how much they would’ve put up to scoop Dame’s portion of the Roc. “Let’s just say, Killah, I did—for $20. Times who knows how much? Let’s just say, hypothetically, right? Would that be a grand master chess move?” Then Cam chimed in, directly replying to <a href=#>his co-host’s “hypothetical” scenario</a>. “I’m just doing business, bro, I’m not here trying to [play] games of chess against anybody, I’m here solely for business,” he said with a smirk.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The “Welcome Back” rapper continued to toss “allegeds” and “reportedlys” off of Cam. He then quipped that the new deal got him feeling like Birdman. “I mean, of course, we doing business together, whatever business that is,” Ma$e added. “I feel like rubbing the Birdman hands. I love it when a plan come together,” as they shared another laugh.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The conversation continued with less laughter, but with more detailed examples and highly specific names involved. Ma$e asked Cam who would he sell the record label to, if it came down to that.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Right now, I just probably will hold on to it for a little while,” Cam expressed “Like the <a href=# id=auto-tag_wu-tang data-tag=wu-tang>Wu-Tang</a> album,” Mase quipped, referencing 2015’s&nbsp;Once Upon a Time in Shaolin.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“So, we bought&nbsp;Reasonable Doubt, you’ll hold it for a little while?” Mase followed up. It should be noted that both Cam and Ma$e previously had beef with <a href=# id=auto-tag_jay-z data-tag=jay-z>Jay-Z</a>. While Cam has squashed his issues with the icon, Ma$e has yet to publicly do so.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Yeah, I mean what would you like to do?” Cam responded. “It’s a classic, man. And [for] it to be like, ours, hypothetically—I don’t know at this point, the phone’s open.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I was thinking, if I had it you know…Who would I sell it to? I’ll probably sell it to Drake. Drake probably will want to buy it from me, hypothetically…Hypothetically, I’d go to the brunch the next time, and I’d do some good for hip-hop,” Mase answered. “I’d sell it back to the original owners…Be a hero instead of a villain with it. Be the bigger person, I’d sell it back.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The two men also joked about selling the shares to <a href=# id=auto-tag_nas data-tag=nas>Nas</a> because, of course, they would.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">According to <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Radar Online</a>, a judge ordered Dame Dash to sell his shares of <a href=# id=auto-tag_roc-a-fella-records data-tag=roc-a-fella-records>Roc-A-Fella Records</a>. The court decision was determined as the best way to pay off a $823,000 debt Dash amassed after losing a 2022 lawsuit. At one point, Jay-Z even attempted to step in and stop the legal motion from happening.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Roc-A-Fella shares are now set to be sold off at a future public auction. So, Cam and Ma$e’s story is truly “hypothetical.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5iurr7Op2SmmaOaeqWtzJ5knZmjnXqzu8JmmGaelaG5onnSoZirnaNifnN%2Fk3Fsb2pgZXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./euphoria-star-storm-reid-s-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>'Euphoria' Star Storm Reid's Net Worth</span></a>
