He is the son of the <a href=#>famous Hungarian photographer Sylvia Plachy</a> and was born and raised in Queens, New York. Adrien attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, followed by the LaGuardia High School for the Performing Arts in New York.</p><p>Adrien Brody shot to overnight stardom after his role in the 2002 Roman Polinski-directed war drama movie The Pianist. He nailed the role of pianist Władysław Szpilman in the film and won an Academy Award for it. Here is a look at the success story of the critically acclaimed actor.</p><h2 id=brody-s-love-for-acting>Brody's Love For Acting</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Adrien Brody was quite the performer even before he started acting. As a child, he would perform magic shows at birthday parties, calling himself ‘The Amazing Adrien,’ which he would eventually become. Adrien accompanied her photographer mother, Sylvia, on her assignments for The Village Voice. He often credits her for making him comfortable in front of the camera, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDB</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Look Back At Raquel Welch's Career In Hollywood</a></span></p><p>Adrien’s parents foresaw his acting talent and enrolled him in acting classes early in childhood. By the time he reached high school, he was already doing roles in Off-Broadway plays, and by the age of 15, he starred in the 1988 television movie <i>Home at Last, </i>playing an orphan as per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britannica</a>. Adrien made his <a href=#>big-screen debut as a child artist</a> in 1989 with the anthology movie <i>New York Stories.</i></p><h2 id=the-string-of-supporting-roles-before-landing-the-pianist>The String Of Supporting Roles Before Landing 'The Pianist'</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even with venturing into acting early in his career, Adrien Brody never found immediate success and recognition.

In 1998, he played the role of Cpl. Geoffrey Fife in Terrence Malick's <i>The Thin Red Line. </i>The movie was supposed to be Adrien’s big break as he delivered a powerful performance. Still, his character was cut short at the editing table, as per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, thus delaying his well-deserved recognition.</p><h2 id=inside-brody-s-stardom>Inside Brody's Stardom&nbsp;</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After <i>The Thin Red Line </i>disappointment, Adrien Brody did not lose hope and continued garnering praise with his roles in Spike Lee’s <i>Summer of Sam </i>and Barry Levinson’s <i>Liberty Heights</i> in 1999 and Ken Loach’s <i>Bread and Roses</i> in 2000. Despite all these critically acclaimed roles, Adrien Brody kept knocking at the gates of stardom while still being on the brink of becoming a star.</p><p>It was in 2002 that the tides would change for Adrien Brody. He starred in the lead role in Roman Polinski’s war drama movie <i>The Pianist. He delivered</i> a haunting performance for the ages playing the part of the Holocaust-affected pianist Władysław Szpilman. The film opened to rave reviews from critics and audiences swooning over Adrien’s legendary performance. The part opened a floodgate of awards for Adrien, and he won his first Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, becoming the youngest actor to win in this category, as per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fandom</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout 2003, Adrien won and was nominated for several prestigious awards for his role in <i>The Pianist</i>.

Later in his career, he played the role of the famous magician Harry Houdini in History Channel’s 2014 Mini-series <i>Houdini, </i>for which he was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award.

With his sheer love for acting, he turned the tides his way and established himself as a critically acclaimed Hollywood star.
