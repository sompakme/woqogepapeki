At the time, sources said the actor was seeking help for unresolved trauma and substance abuse.</p><p>“Everyone looks at Armie thinking that he’s had some sort of privileged life—and that must mean there were no problems in his youth and everything was peachy keen,” said source told Vanity Fair. “But that’s not necessarily the way things go.</p><p>The Guest House touts itself as a facility largely geared towards celebrity and affluent&nbsp;clientele.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“<a href=#>Our programs are open to all adults</a> over the age of 18, though we cater in particular to clients who have high-stress or high-visibility lifestyles such as business executives, politicians and entertainment professionals, as well as all those whose lives have lacked guidance or support,” its website reads.</p><p>That year, an Instagram account shared text messages allegedly from Armie, which described a number of disturbing sexual fantasies, including cannibalism and assault.</p><p>Soon after, multiple women who claimed to have dated the actor spoke to Page Six and recounted the abuse they say he subjected them to.
