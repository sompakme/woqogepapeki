A second source says that Kelce will be shooting a commercial in Los Angeles the weekend of April 12, which is keeping him close to Swift.</p><p>“Taylor is very excited about the opportunities Travis is getting and fully supports him,” a third source says. “[But] she wants him to be conscious of his schedule. The only issue is making sure they can see each other.”</p><p>The couple, who began dating in summer 2023, have been together nonstop since Swift completed her Eras Tour shows in Singapore in early March. Prior to that, Kelce joined Swift in both Australia and Singapore to support her after she flew to Las Vegas in February to <a href=#>cheer him on in the Super Bowl</a>.
