Jack was raised on a horse farm together with his younger brother Clay Harlow. His family moved from Shelbyville to Louisville where he began rapping at an early age of 12. Together with his friend Copeland, they used Guitar Hero microphone with a laptop to <a href=#>record different rhymes and songs</a> that they both worked hard on. Eventually they were able to make a CD with all the songs in it entitled Rippin' and Rappin'. They sold the copies of the CD in their school, Highland Middle School which was a total hit among their schoolmates.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Jack reached seventh grade, he acquired a professional microphone to produce his first ever mixtape entitled Extra Credit and using the moniker Mr. Harlow. During that time he has also formed a collective titled Moose Gang with his friends. While <a href=#>working on this with his friends</a>, he was also working on two more mixtapes titled Music for the Deaf and Moose Gang, which were sadly never released to the public. Throughout his High School years, Jack has performed numerous sold out shows at different Louisville venues such as Haymarket Whiskey Bar and Mercury Ballroom.</p><h2 id=starting-the-next-chapter-in-his-life>Starting The Next Chapter In His Life</h2><p>With his talent and efforts, he was able to release his first ever commercial album titled The Handsome Harlow which was released through the record label Gill Holland's sonaBLAST. His high school years were spent performing on numerous venues and he ended up opening for Vince Staples in Louisville. Right after he graduated from the Atherton High School, he released his mixtape 18 which was the first ever album that was included on his label and musical collective, Private Garden. The said collective features different collaborators including 2forwOyNE, Shloob, Quiiso, the Homies and a lot more. Over the course of the following years, he performed at numerous music festivals including the Bonnaroo Music Festival, and the Forecastle Festival.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Two years after <a href=#>he released his commercial album</a>, he released his first ever single entitled Routine in the summer of 2017. That same year, he released another single titled Dark Knight with a music video in October 2017. The said single was released through the help of his friend Cyhi the Prynce who helped him deal with his writer's block and be able to finish the song. His single Dark Knight became the lead single on his mixtape Gazebo which was released on November 2017. Right after the release of his single, he went on a 14-city Gazebo Tour for his album. The Homies then opened for Jack and ended the tour on January 2018.</p><h2 id=breaking-through-in-the-music-scene>Breaking Through In The Music Scene</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With his determination to succeed in the music scene, Jack Harlow is slowly making a name for himself. He moved to Atlanta to further pursue his career while working at the Georgia State University cafeteria to support himself financially. During the time he was working at the cafeteria, he was introduced to DJ Drama at Mean Street Studio which later on changed his life. Due to this fateful introduction, it was announced that he signed with the Generation Now record label owned by DJ Drama and Don Cannon in August 2018. <a href=#>On the same day of the announcement</a>, he released the music video for his single Sundown. A few months after he signed with the record label, he embarked on a North American tour in November 2018 which ended in December.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With all the success he is achieving one by one, he was able to release his single What’s Poppin on January 21, 2020 which led him to his career breakthrough. His song became viral on the social media platform, Tiktok and even surpassed about 135 million views. There’s no one stopping Jack Harlow at this point when he released yet another single titled Tyler Herro which was the single on his debut studio album. The song earned positive reviews from the critics citing that it has this weightless charisma vibe into it. He has since collaborated with numerous iconic music artists including Adam Levine for the song Same Guy, Chris Brown for the song Already Best Friends and Eminem and Cordae for the remix of Eminem’s single Killer. He just released his second studio album Nail Tech last month and had his acting debut this month for the reboot of the 1992 movie White Men Can’t Jump who was directed by Calmatic.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Lil Nas X Expresses Regret Over A $2,000 Purchase After Signing Recording Contract</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, <a href=#>Disco Tech</a>, <a href=#>Wealthy Gorilla</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1pr7ErGShp6dit6KvymafmqqcpMRuvs6snGasn2KzornEZpinnF2bvLPA1KecaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dj-lemahieu-has-been-married-to-his-wife-jordan-lemahieu-since-2014.html><span>←</span><span>DJ LeMahieu has been Married to his Wife, Jordan LeMahieu, since 2014</span></a>
