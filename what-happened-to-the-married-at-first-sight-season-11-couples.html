Running from April to October 2020, audiences were introduced to five men and five women who declared themselves ready for marriage.</p><p>Bennet Kirschner, Amelia Fatsi, Brett Lindsey, Olivia Cornu, Henry Rodriguez, Christina Croce, Woody Randall, Amani Smith, Miles Williams, and Karen Landry all stepped in front of the camera, putting their hearts on the line in hopes of finding their forever loves. Almost two years after the final episode has aired, fans everywhere are wondering: What happened to the season 11 couples?</p><h2 id=bennet-kirschner-is-focusing-on-his-career><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Bennet Kirschner Is Focusing On His Career</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bennet Kirschner was paired with Amelia Fatsi for season 11 of this show. The couple quickly became a fan favorite, with their immediate chemistry and attraction upon meeting. On decision day, the two decided to remain married, making audiences around America cheer. Unfortunately, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amelia and Bennet quietly divorced</a> a year later. Bennet has taken this as an opportunity to focus on his career in the theater with his company Intramural Theater.</p><h2 id=amelia-fatsi-has-a-new-boyfriend><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Amelia Fatsi Has A New Boyfriend</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While details of the divorce have not been made public, it seems that it was mostly drama-free and that Amelia and Bennet are still friendly. Since the split last October, Amelia has gone on to meet a new beau. She is now in a relationship with Alexander Bayer, an avid adventurer and Yoga Coach. It hasn’t been determined when they started dating, but Amelia posted a photo of him and herself in January of this year.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Married At First Sight Couples Break Up Amid Rumors The Show Is Utterly Fake</a></span></p><h2 id=brett-lindsey-mostly-posts-about-cats-amp-restaurants><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Brett Lindsey Mostly Posts About Cats & Restaurants</span></h2><p>Brett Lindsey and Olivia Cornu were seemingly doomed from the start. From the beginning of the season, it was obvious that the couple had to work on their communication and trust. At the end of the show, they both decided to get a divorce, and Brett has dedicated his life to finding delicious restaurants and loving on cats. He posted photos with a supposed girlfriend on Instagram last year, but he seems to be single again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=olivia-cornu-is-finding-ways-to-enjoy-her-singleness><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Olivia Cornu Is Finding Ways To Enjoy Her Singleness</span></h2><p>Olivia Cornu’s downfall in her marriage was her inability to compromise with Brett and their constant disagreements. After divorcing, Olivia has taken time to herself and is spending this single season trying to live her best life. She is a nurse practitioner, dog and cat mom, runner, and just recently started a true-crime podcast called Check the Locks with her friend John Conner.</p><h2 id=christina-croce-keeps-her-life-on-the-down-low><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Christina Croce Keeps Her Life On The Down-Low</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On decision day, Henry Rodriguez and Christina Croce chose to end their marriage. While the romance didn’t take off, the couple remained amiable with each other and wished one another the best of luck with their lives as individuals. Christina has since kept her life on the DL, keeping any of her social media profiles on private and her personal life, well, personal.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened To The 'Married At First Sight' Season 14 Couples?</a></span></p><h2 id=henry-rodriguez-has-found-a-new-lady><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Henry Rodriguez Has Found A New Lady</span></h2><p>Henry Rodriguez has moved on from his divorce and is currently dating a woman named Kayla McCormick. The couple has been together for over a year, first posting on social media about her on Independence Day last year. Kayla and Henry are not shy about posting their date nights on Instagram, and the two seem to be very happy together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=amani-amp-woody-randall-are-a-happy-family><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Amani & Woody Randall Are A Happy Family</span></h2><p>Amani and Woody Randall quickly become another fan favorite couple of the season. It was evident from the start that they were infatuated with each other, so it wasn’t much of a surprise that they decided to stay married. The two love to share their married life on social media, and even announced the birth of their first child, a son named Reign, last month.</p><h2 id=karen-amp-miles-williams-are-thriving-as-spouses><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Karen & Miles Williams Are Thriving As Spouses</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Karen and Miles Williams are the only other couple to make it through decision day married who remain married today.
