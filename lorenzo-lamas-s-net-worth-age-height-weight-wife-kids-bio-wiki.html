If you do not know, We have prepared this article about details of Lorenzo Lamas’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life></span>Early Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The American actor was born on January 20, 1957, in Santa Monica, California, to his actor parents. His father, Fernando Lamas, was an Argentine actor while his mother, Arlene Dahl, was a Norwegian American actress. Lorenzo was raised in Pacific Palisades, California. When he was a little kid, his parents got separated.</p><p>Thereafter, he moved to New York City. There is not much information about his early education, but he is said to have graduated from ‘Admiral Farragut Academy’ in 1975. Following that, he took the martial art training.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=personal-life></span>Personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lorenzo’s personal life has been subject to a happening life. He got married five times and is present with Shawna Craig, his 5th wife, whom he married in 2011. Before that, he had married and divorced Victoria Hilbert, Michelle Smith, Kathleen Kinmont, and Shauna Sand. Out of 5 marriages, he has six children.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=age-height-and-weight></span>Age, Height, and Weight<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Being born on 20 January 1958, Lorenzo Lamas is 63 years old as of today’s date 24th January 2021. His height is 1.88 m&nbsp; tall, and his weight is 80 kg.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span>Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lorenzo Lamas is the son of actor parents, so naturally, he too dreamt of becoming an actor like his parents. In fact, he started learning acting at a very early age. After attending Tony Barr’s Film Actors Workshops, he broke into acting in 1976. It was a small TV role.</p><p>For the next four years, he made a guest appearance and cameo in a number of films, but none of them could really make him popular. Finally, in 1981, he landed a role in all-time popular TV series Falcon Crest. After this, his career remained the same no more. He continuously appeared in 227 episodes of this TV series and bagged huge accolades, acclaim, and several awards.</p><p>Along with this TV series, he appeared in other TV series and films too. However, he couldn’t gain the success that he achieved with this TV series. As he is a skilled martial artist, he majorly appeared in action movies. Bounty Tracker, Final Impact, and Snake Eater are some of the most popular films of Lorenzo.</p><p>He appeared in nearly 50 films, but only a few films turned out to be successful. He also appeared in a number of TV series, including Renegade, Leave it to Lamas, California Fever, and Falcon Crest.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=awards-achievements></span>Awards & achievements<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lorenzo Lamas has several nominations such as Razzie Award, Soap Opera Digest Award, Golden Globe Award, and Golden Rose Award. Talking about the award he has won, he has won the Golden Apple Award.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth-salary-of-lorenzo-lamas></span>Net Worth & Salary of Lorenzo Lamas<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lorenzo Lamas was born in an actor’s family. Still, he couldn’t have a successful career as an actor. Recently, he hasn’t been much active in the film industry either. So, Lorenzo Lamas might not have a huge net worth under his name. Lorenzo Lamas has a good net worth of $5 million as of January 2021. In 2016, he started working as a helicopter pilot and is almost off the glamour world.</p><p>Lorenzo Lamas’s professional career has been affected due to his personal life. Maybe, that’s why he could never taste the giant success over his entire career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKSfp7Kvxs5mo5qlkajAbrrErWSwp6KptW6txp5koZ2ZnLW1edaeoKCgpGLEqrLEZqKinKNir6q7jLCgpKFf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./henry-golding-news-us-weekly.html><span>←</span><span>henry golding News - Us Weekly</span></a>
