I’m having fun. As soon as I get kicked off the show, it’s probably going to go away.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Chrishell-Stause-DWTS-Body-Transformation-Side-by-Side.jpg><p>Stause <a href=#>gave an emotional performance</a> on Monday night dedicated to her late parents, who both died of lung cancer. Her father, Jeff, passed away in April 2019, while Ranae, her mom, <a href=#>succumbed to the illness</a> earlier this year. The song she danced to on Monday, “Stars” by Grace Potter and the Nocturnals, holds a special place in the realtor’s heart.</p><p>“It was one of the songs I listened to on repeat when I was dealing with the loss of my parents,” Stause said during her rehearsals, reflecting on her mom’s memory. “Right before I dance, I really feel her calm me [and] encourage me. That has been the most special thing that I will take away from this show. … This dance is for them.”</p><p>Following the death of her mother in July, Stause admitted that she was<a href=#> hesitant to accept the challenge</a> of dancing on national TV. However, she had a feeling that taking the stage would make her mom proud.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Chrishell-Stause-DWTS-Body-Transformation-2.jpg><p>“There was definitely that moment where something so unexpected — where you have that moment of pause,” the former soap actress told Us and other reporters in September. “But if I’ve learned anything this year in losing my mom, is that life [is] short. We don’t know how long we’re here for and <a href=#>you have to make the most of it</a>. … [My mom] would have been the first person to tell me to get out there and give it your best shot.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Days of Our Lives alum</a> has faced a number of ups and downs over the last year, including her November 2019 split from <a href=#><strong>Justin Hartley</strong></a>, who filed for divorce after two years of marriage. Earlier this year, a source told Us exclusively that Stause “was knocked sideways for a while” by <a href=#>the “roller-coaster” of emotions</a> she felt after her split, but she’s “looking forward to finding love again someday.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGacoKKewKmxy6VkrKyRqsCmecisZJ6wk57BprCMmpmoraRitaa%2BjJ2uratdl7ylxYytqZqmo5u8s7nAraCopl8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./20-celebrities-who-don-t-use-their-real-name-and-for-good-reason.html><span>←</span><span>20 Celebrities Who Don't Use Their Real Name (And For Good Reason)</span></a>
