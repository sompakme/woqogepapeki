In the picture, the<a href=#>&nbsp;</a><i><a href=#>Pretty Little Liars: The Perfectionists</a>&nbsp;</i>alum plays&nbsp;<a href=#>an aspiring musician</a> who has struggled to afford her <a href=#>Type 1 diabetes</a> medication. In order to help cover the costs of insulin, Cassie agrees to marry a Marine (<a href=#><strong>Nicholas Galitzine</strong></a>) for his health insurance plan and military spouse monetary stipend.</p><p class=p1>While&nbsp;<i>Purple Hearts&nbsp;</i>was initially billed as <a href=#>a romance between a more liberal woman and a conservative man</a> stuck in a fake dating scheme, it soon caught flak from critics. Several viewers were concerned about the movie’s misogynistic and racist undertones. (At one point, one of the 27-year-old&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Cinderella</a>&nbsp;</i>actor’s fellow soldiers even shouts, “This one is to life, love and hunting down some goddamn Arabs, baby!”)</p><p class=p1>“The way<i>&nbsp;Purple Hearts</i>&nbsp;isn’t even sublte [sic] but blatantly anti arab anti hispanic racist misogynistic AND pro military propaganda but ppl are frothing at the mouth bc enemies to lovers,” one social media user tweeted earlier this month, criticizing its plot. “YEAH THEY’RE ENEMIES BCS HE’S A PRO GUN CONSERVATIVE SOLDIER AND SHE’S A LATINA LIBERAL.”</p><p class=p1>Another Twitter user added: “<i>Purple Hearts&nbsp;</i>is not a romance it is a horror film because I literally cannot think of anything more terrifying than having to marry a military dude to afford my insulin.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Sofia-Carson-Defends-Her-Film-Purple-Hearts-Amid-Viewer-Criticism-Over-Problematic-Themes-Inline-1.jpg><p class=p1>Despite disappointment in the film,&nbsp;<i>Purple Hearts&nbsp;</i>has <a href=#>remained in Netflix’s Top 10 programs since its premiere</a>. Carson, for her part, has swiftly defended the production amid the criticism.</p><p class=p1>“We wanted to represent both sides as accurately as possible,” the&nbsp;<i>Feel the Beat&nbsp;</i>star, who also served as an executive producer on the film, told the outlet. “What I think I’ve learned to do as an artist is separate myself from all of that and just listen to what the world is feeling and reacting to with the film. That has been so beautifully overwhelming and so many people have felt seen or are comforted by this movie. That’s all we could want [as] filmmakers and as artists.”</p><p class=p1><i>Purple Hearts</i>’ director, <strong>Elizabeth Allen Rosenbaum</strong>, also shut down the backlash.</p><p class=p1>“They are flawed at the beginning and that was intentional,” the New York native told&nbsp;<i>Variety&nbsp;</i>in August. “In order for the red heart and the blue heart to kind of turn purple, you have to have them be kind of extreme. Some of the people that they’re surrounded with are even more flawed than they are. They both have been neglected by the system; he’s hurt in a war that doesn’t seem to be ending and she’s <a href=#>slipping through the cracks of the healthcare system</a>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Sofia-Carson-Defends-Her-Film-Purple-Hearts-Amid-Viewer-Criticism-Over-Problematic-Themes-Inline.jpg><p class=p1>She added: “I do hope that anyone who’s in any way insulted by it understands that our intentions are very pure, and it’s because we feel like people need to grow and need to start to become more moderate.”</p><p class=p1>The film has been praised for <a href=#>its accurate depiction of Type 1 diabetes</a>. “As we were learning more and more about type 1 diabetes and developing Cassie, we learned that it’s, frankly, highly underrepresented in film and TV and in media,” Carson told&nbsp;<i><a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>&nbsp;</i>on Friday, August 13. “An issue that needs to be spoken of is the insulin crisis in this country and the health care crisis in this country, how there are countless girls and men and women like Cassie who literally can’t afford the insulin that they need to survive.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The actress noted: “I learned a lot about what it means to be a type 1 diabetic, what my daily life would look like. We had a doctor on set as well who taught me about the insulin pump, the injections and how I should be acting when I had a low-blood-sugar attack.”</p><p class=p1><i>Purple Hearts</i>&nbsp;is currently streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqonpmWeqSt0aymp2WUmrOmusOsZKmtoqW5pnnHnpirrKNirq61w2atop2nmr9ursCcoqWZo518</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./prince-al-waleed-bin-talal-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal Net Worth</span></a>
