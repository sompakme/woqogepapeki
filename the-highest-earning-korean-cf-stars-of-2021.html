Thus, it is common for these most sought-after celebrities to earn outrageous amounts of money from CFs. Recently, a list of the stars who have earned the most <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this year through CFs alone</a> was released by the Entertainment Company Live, a variety show in South Korea.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These stars do not only rake in a hefty amount of cash from their album sales or per episode fees for actors in their current hit dramas, but they also make a huge amount of fortune from multiple brand endorsement deals. Most of these deals are made during the airing of a hit drama of an actor which hits high ratings in the viewership; some artists also close these deals for brand endorsements once their hit songs make waves in South Korea. Find out in the list below the top celebrity endorsers in South Korea.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Baby Mochi's Birthday: BTS Star Jimin Celebrates His Birthday By Making A Gigantic Donation</a></span></p><h2 id=youn-yuh-jung>Youn Yuh-jung</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With estimated earnings of 2.1 billion won, which is approximately $1.7 million, Youn Yuh-Jung takes the eighth spot on the list.

One of the most prominent endorsements of Jennie is her deal with the soju brand Chum Churum. It is not surprising that a member of the hottest girl group in the world has made it to the list, let alone the most loved member of the group. She has earned $4.1 million just for five brand endorsements in 2021 alone. She has signed additional three new endorsements that were previously endorsed by the CF Queen, idol, and actress Bae Suzy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=son-heung-min>Son Heung-Min</h2><p>With estimated earnings of 6 billion won, which is approximately US$5 million, Son Heung-min takes the fifth spot on the list.

He has only filmed six CFs this year alone but already earned $5 million.</p><h2 id=jo-jung-suk>Jo Jung-Suk</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With estimated earnings of 7.7 billion won, which is approximately $6.5 million, Jo Jung-suk takes the fourth spot on the list.

This list will not be complete if BTS is not included. With the members V, Jimin, RM, J-Hope, Jin, Suga, and Jungkook taking the world by a storm, topping this list is not at all surprising.
