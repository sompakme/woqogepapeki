<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Christian Cages Best AEW Feuds</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><a href=#>Christian Cage</a>‘s current run in AEW has seen him make more enemies than friends. The reigning TNT Champion is doing some of the best work of his career in Tony Khan’s promotion. Plus, his in-ring performance is arguably on a par with the work he put against Randy Orton during their illustrious feud in 2011 despite being 49 in 2023.</p><p>Christian Cage has thus far feuded with the likes of Kenny Omega, Adam Cole, and Jack Perry to name a few. He probably would’ve turned his short-program with CM Punk on Collision into full-blown feud had the “Real” AEW World Champion stayed with the company past All In. But that’s a story for another time.</p><p>For now, let’s take a look at Christian Cage’s five best feuds in AEW.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Wardlow</h2><p>The feud between Wardlow and Christian Cage didn’t extend past Double or Nothing, but it did give fans some awesome heel Christian promos. Mr. Mayhem, like all those before him, became the target of Christian’s vicious diatribe against dead fathers – even if it was for a brief moment.</p><p>After feuding for several weeks, Wardlow triumphed over Christian Cage by defeating him in their Ladder Match for the TNT Championship at Double or Nothing 2023.</p><p>AEW should’ve continued the program between Wardlow with Christian Cage after Mr. Mayhem dropped the TNT title to Luchasaurus on the premiere episode of AEW Collision.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Adam Cole</h2><p>Adam Cole’s AEW debut at All Out saw him take out Christian Cage and Jurassic Express with the help of the Young Bucks. The confrontation led to a full-fledged program between the babyfaces and the heels.</p><p>Cole, Nick and Matt Jackson formed Superkliq to take on Christian, Jack Perry, and Luchausarus. The six men had a five-star Falls Count Anywhere Match at Full Gear 2021. The feud with Adam Cole and Bucks brought out the best in Christian Cage.</p><p>Cole would defeat Christian on the April 6, 2022, episode of Dynamite to end their feud.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2>Kenny Omega gave Christian Cage his first singles loss in AEW</h2><p>Kenny Omega had some incredibly feuds in 2021 and one of the confrontations came against Christian Cage. Captain Charisma started his AEW career on a high note as he embarked on on undefeated streak. The pair had the distinction of being the first match in Rampage history on August 13, 2021.</p><p>Christian would beat Omega for the IMPACT World Championship with a brutal Kill Switch on a steel chair. However, he failed to defeat the Cleaner in their second outing at All Out 2021 for the AEW World Championship, making it Christian’s first loss in Tony Khan’s promotion.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Darby Allin</h2><p>At the time of the writing, Darby Allin is the latest victim of Christian Cage’s crusade against homegrown AEW talents and their deceased relatives. The feud was tied into Christian’s obsession with winning the TNT Championship, which had been synonymous with Darby up to that point.</p><p>Darby had the upper hand in most of their singles and tag team meetings until Christian Cage did the unthinkable by becoming the new TNT Champion in a three-way ladder match also involving Luchasaurus on the September 23, 2023, episode of Collision. This set up a rematch between the pair in the main event of WrestleDream.</p><p>The 2-out-of-3 Falls Match was extremely brutal. It featured many high-risk spots, including the extremely stiff slam on the steel steps that almost broke Darby Allin’s back. The outcome saw Nick Wayne’s shocking betrayal and subsequent alliance with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">new father figure</a> Christian Cage.</p><p>The feud really brought so many emotions on so many different levels, and made Christian Cage the most despised heel in AEW. Plus, it capped off with the arrival of his childhood friend Adam Copeland.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wrestlezone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2023/03/jungle-boy-jack-perry.jpg><h2 id=h-jack-perry-literally-buried-christian-cage>Jack Perry literally buried Christian Cage</h2><p>After making his AEW debut at Revolution 2021, Christian Cage subsequently became a mentor to “Jungle Boy” Jack Perry. The pair teamed up alongside Luchasaurus on multiple occasions before Christian betrayed Jack Perry AEW Dynamite: Road Rager on June 15, 2022.</p><p>The shocking betrayal kicked off a heated feud between the teacher and the student. Christian stooped to a new low when he brought Jack’s later father Luke Perry into the feud. He also called out his mother on live television.</p><p>The feud really elevated the careers of Jack Perry and Luchasaurus, who became Christian Cage’s bodyguard in the heated saga. After losing to Christian at All Out 2022, Perry defeated his mentor in their Final Burial Match at Revolution 2023.</p><p>: <a href=#>Adam Copeland Asks&nbsp;Christian&nbsp;Cage&nbsp;To Team With Him Again,&nbsp;Christian&nbsp;Says Go F-ck Yourself</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaJ6VlsG2vsSsZpudo6l6uL7ErKuloZ6cfHKAkGlvbnFdmLWztdKtoJqmXZiuqLGMm5ysrF2Wsrh5xZ6snas%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=next href=./ivana-trump-made-a-fortune-off-her-divorce-settlement-from-donald-but-melania-could-make-more-than.html><span>Ivana Trump Made A Fortune Off Her Divorce Settlement From Donald, But Melania Could Make More Than </span><span>→</span></a></nav></article></main><footer class=footer><p>&copy; 2024 <a href=./></a></p><p>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Hugo️️</a>️</p></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
