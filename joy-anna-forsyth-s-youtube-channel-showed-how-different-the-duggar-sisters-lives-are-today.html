Many are realizing that Joy-Anna has chosen to live a much different life than she was raised in.

In 2023, Joy-Anna held a sleepover at her home in Arkansas while her husband was on a hunting trip with his family.</p><p>The group included sisters Josie, Johannah, Jennifer, Jordan, and their cousin Emily. Among the activities, the group watched old episodes of I Love Lucy and stayed up late talking.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/jill-duggar-and-derek-dillard.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Jill Duggar’s Husband Threatens Protective Order Against Her Dad As They Argue Over Money</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Jill and Derick Duggar aren't afraid of taking legal action against her parents as their conflict escalates.</span><p>After the fun and games, the five guests retreated off to sleep in the extra bedroom, and Joy-Anna took time to reflect on how nice the evening had been and how she now had to get as much sleep as possible before her children woke up, including her youngest son Gunner.</p><h2 id=the-duggar-family-went-without-much-technology>The Duggar Family Went Without Much Technology</h2><h3 id=joy-anna-39-s-siblings-were-not-allowed-to-watch-tv-growing-up-but-they-watched-shows-at-her-house>Joy-Anna's siblings were not allowed to watch TV growing up, but they watched shows at her house</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/19-kids-and-counting-duggars.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the biggest things that caught the eye of those watching Joy-Anna's YouTube video was the realization that the sisters were watching television at all. Growing up, the Duggar children were strictly regulated in their television and technology use.</p><p>In fact, the family didn't watch TV while living under their parents' roof. While Joy-Anna is grown and able to make her own decisions in her home, many were shocked to see the younger Duggar children enjoying technology while at Joy's home.</p><p><a href=#>Joy-Anna Forsyth has quickly become a relatable member of the Duggar family</a>. Although audiences see her watching television, she is quick to point out that they try not to watch it often. They store it in a separate room and only take it out on the weekends to avoid having too much screen time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the past, Joy-Anna told fans that it was too easy to get sucked into watching TV and that during the winter months, she and her husband would end up watching several movies per evening because the time went so fast.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/jim-bob-and-michelle-duggar-for-tlc.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Jill Dillard Finally Revealed The Extent Of Jim Bob Duggar's Control Over His Kids' Lives</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Jill Dillard is spilling all the tea, including details about her dad Jim Bob Duggar's perhaps questionable tax activities.</span><p>Even after marrying her husband, Austin Forsyth, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joy-Anna still held on to many of the principles she grew up with</a>. However, viewers can now see that she doesn't abide by the strict dress code that she was once forced to use and that her children aren't growing up with the same restrictions that were part of her unique childhood.</p><h2 id=now-grown-many-duggars-enjoy-life-39-s-luxuries>Now Grown, Many Duggars Enjoy Life's Luxuries</h2><h3></h3><h3 id=life-is-very-different-for-the-now-grown-duggar-kids>Life is very different for the now-grown Duggar kids</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/austin-forsyth-and-joy-anna-duggar-on-counting-on.jpg><p>While <a href=#>Joy-Anna is more vocal about deviating from her childhood regulations</a>, she isn't the only Duggar family member to branch out and enjoy more of what life offers. Social media posts have shown some of the older Duggar siblings watching popular Christmas movies such as Home Alone and Elf, which they would never have been able to do before.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What's more, even Anna Duggar has admitted that her children watch television programming. However, she does go on to say that their TV set retracts back into their fireplace when not in use, so they aren't tempted to watch more than they should.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/anna-duggar-speaking-to-tlc.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Fans Think Old Footage Of Josh Duggar Shows There Were More Problems Than Just His Crimes</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Old footage of Josh Duggar had fans even angrier on behalf of his wife Anna.</span><p>As the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forsyth family continues to evolve and experience new things</a>, they are able to see what all life has to offer. After seeing the Duggar children grow up in such confined circumstances, it's refreshing to see them enjoy the little things that many people take for granted.</p><p>Whether it's wearing a pair of jeans or watching social media and sitcoms, seeing them experience the world around them is a new form of entertainment for the viewers who have followed them throughout their lives.</p><p>Does this mean that Jim Bob and Michelle have also relaxed the rules in their home? While the youngest children were seen watching I Love Lucy at Joy-Anna's, it isn't known if that behavior extends to their parent's house.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether or not it does, the Duggar girls are being exposed to the practice of moderation when visiting their sister and her children. At the Forsyth home, they can enjoy a bit of fun and also focus on the critical elements of life, such as conversation and bonding time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqLFdlruvrYyfpqurqam1brDUoJ6aql2brq61y7JksqelqcKjsY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./elvis-presley-s-siblings-what-happened-to-his-twin-brother.html><span>←</span><span>Elvis Presleys Siblings What Happened To His Twin Brother?</span></a>
