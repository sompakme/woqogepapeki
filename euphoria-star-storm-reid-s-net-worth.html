She is constantly working to grow her career, and it's definitely paid off. Her net worth isn't as high as <a href=#>some of her Euphoria cast mates'</a>, but it is more than half a million dollars and will probably be much more than that soon. Let's take a look at how Storm Reid earned her net worth over the years.</p><h2 id=storm-reid-rsquo-s-net-worth-is-around-600-000><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><strong>Storm Reid’s Net Worth Is Around $600,000</strong></span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As of right now, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Storm Reid’s net worth is estimated to be around $600,000</a>. “She makes most of her money from acting in movies and has several endorsements with companies like Mattel! The talented actress is also the face of several brands and earns as a brand ambassador,” according to The Little Facts. Although Storm is one of the richest 18-year-olds in the country, it’s surprising that her net worth isn’t higher considering all of the TV shows and movies she’s starred in.</p><h2 id=she-got-her-big-break-when-she-was-10-years-old><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><strong>She Got Her Big Break When She Was 10 Years Old</strong></span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2013, Storm Reid got her big break when she starred in 12 Years a Slave. She played Emily, who is Eliza’s daughter. “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eliza is a slave with 2 children—Randall and Emily</a>; we know her as a smart, strong woman (as Solomon Northup describes her), eventually devastated by the loss of her children,” according to Shadow and Act. Storm was only 10 years old and her movie debut became a huge success. The film won three Oscars and was nominated for six more.</p><h2 id=storm-reid-has-starred-in-a-couple-of-nickelodeon-shows><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><strong>Storm Reid Has Starred In A Couple Of Nickelodeon Shows</strong></span></h2><p>The same year that Storm played Emily in 12 Years a Slave, she played Avery in the Nickelodeon show, The Thundermans. She only starred in one episode, “This Looks Like a Job For…,” which is about the main characters getting jobs at a pizza parlor. Even though it was only one episode, it helped her receive other acting gigs, including a role on another Nickelodeon show. She acted in Nicky, Ricky, Dicky & Dawn a year later and played Scarlett in the episode, “Scaredy Dance,” which is about the Halloween school dance. Around the same time, Storm also made a few appearances in other TV shows, such as NCIS: Los Angeles and Chicago P.D.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lsquo-a-wrinkle-in-time-rsquo-and-lsquo-euphoria-rsquo-made-storm-reid-famous><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>‘A Wrinkle In Time’ And ‘Euphoria’ Made Storm Reid Famous</strong></span></h2><p>After Storm made a few appearances on TV shows, she started starring in more movies, including the one which made her famous: A Wrinkle in Time. According to Good Morning America, the movie is about “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a girl who [is] on a quest to save her father </a>as well as all of space and time, [which is] based on Madeleine L'Engle's classic 1962 book of the same name.” Storm played Meg, who is the main character trying to save her father. Since it’s a Disney movie, it gained a lot of people’s attention, and they got to see how talented Storm Reid truly is. This led her to starring in the popular TV show, Euphoria. She plays Rue’s sister, Gia and the show has made her even more famous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why The Filming Of 'Euphoria' Looks Completely Different In Season 2</a></span></p><h2 id=storm-reid-starred-in-two-popular-movies-over-the-past-couple-years><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>Storm Reid Starred In Two Popular Movies Over The Past Couple Years</strong></span></h2><p>After the first season of Euphoria, Storm starred in two popular movies, The Invisible Man and the newest version of The Suicide Squad. According to IMDb, The Invisible Man is about “when Cecilia's abusive ex takes his own life and leaves her his fortune, she suspects his death was a hoax. As a series of coincidences turn lethal, Cecilia works to prove that she is being hunted by someone nobody can see.” Storm played Sydney, who is the daughter of the cop who protects Cecilia from her ex. And in the newest version of The Suicide Squad, she played Tyla.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=storm-reid-is-going-to-be-in-four-upcoming-movies><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>Storm Reid Is Going To Be In Four Upcoming Movies</strong></span></h2><p>The latest version of The Suicide Squad came out last year and Storm has already been working on a lot of projects since then. Over the next couple of years, she’s going to star in at least four new movies. She’s going to be in Killing Winston Jones, One Way (which is set to come out this year), Searching 2, and Darby Harper Wants You to Know. Searching 2 is probably going to launch her career even further since so many people are looking forward to it.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Zendaya's Shocking 'Euphoria' Season 2 Lives Up To Her "Mature Audiences" Warning</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hbo-just-cast-storm-reid-for-the-tv-series-lsquo-the-last-of-us-rsquo><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><strong>HBO Just Cast Storm Reid For The TV Series ‘The Last Of Us’</strong></span></h2><p>On top of the four new movies Storm’s going to be in, she’s going to star in a TV show too. HBO just cast her to star in their new show, The Last of Us. According to GameRant, “Based on Naughty Dog's original game, The Last of Us takes place about 20 years after civilization has been destroyed by a plague that turned people into zombie-like spore monsters. The series, like the game, will reportedly focus on Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) as they try and navigate their way out of a quarantine zone set up by a group of survivors known as The Fireflies… Deadline reports that Storm Reid will join the cast as a special guest star and is set to take on the role of Riley Abel.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=storm-reid-might-be-a-millionaire-soon><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>Storm Reid Might Be A Millionaire Soon</strong></span></h2><p>Storm Reid has already made more than half a million dollars from all the TV shows and movies she’s been in. And she’s making more money every day from the brand endorsements she has. Between the brand endorsements and the new projects she’s working on, her net worth is probably going to be at least a million soon. She might be a millionaire before she’s in her 20’s. This is just the beginning of a long and successful career for Storm. Who knows where her career could take her.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here's What The 'Euphoria' Cast Looked Like When They Were Actually Teenagers</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqraeionqzscidZJ6toJ28s7XAZqWerF2svLPAx2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./zendaya-digs-deep-into-her-past-for-immigrant-heritage-month-video.html><span>←</span><span>Zendaya Digs Deep Into Her Past for Immigrant Heritage Month: Video</span></a>
