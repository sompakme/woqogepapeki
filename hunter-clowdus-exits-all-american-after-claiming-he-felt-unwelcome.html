A rep for the show told <a href=# rel=noopener>TV Line</a> on Friday, March 29, that JJ’s story line “organically wrapped” at the end of season 5.</p><p>JJ faced several ups and downs during season 5, including developing a drinking issue after joining a fraternity. Although he distanced himself from his friends <a href=#>following Coach Baker’s (<strong>Taye Diggs</strong>) death</a>, he’d moved back to the group’s beach house and was on good terms with his friends by the end of the season.</p><p>Off camera, however, there seemed to be issues between Clowdus and some of his All American costars after they <a href=#>wrapped season 5</a>. Eagle eyed fans noticed in fall 2023 that Clowdus unfollowed a few of his castmates and the official All American account on social media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2Hunter-Clowdus-Exiting-All-America-nAhead-of-Season-6-After-Claiming-He-Felt-Unwelcome-on-Set.jpg><p>When asked why he “left” the show in November 2023, Clowdus hinted that it wasn’t his choice.</p><p>“I didn’t want to. I wanted to give the fans and that character proper closure,” the actor replied to a fan <a href=# rel=noopener>via an Instagram comment</a> at the time. “That said I began to feel very unwelcome there and it was really taking a toll on my mental health.”</p><p>Clowdus claimed, “I still wanted to come back for the fans but at the end of the day it was their decision to not continue JJ’s character.”</p><p>In January, Clowdus revealed that he was <a href=# rel=noopener>eight months into a new journey</a> of learning how to golf and traveling to pursue the sport.</p><p>“Your dream, your responsibility. Don’t let anything stop you,” Clowdus <a href=# rel=noopener>wrote via Instagram</a> last month, sharing a video of his gym routine. “Don’t let the opinions of others discourage you from chasing your dreams. It’s your dream and your determination is what will make it a reality. Keep pushing and never give up on what you truly want in life.”</p><p>While Clowdus won’t be back for season 6 of All American, fans will finally get to see Spencer (<strong>Daniel Ezra</strong>) and Olivia (<strong>Samantha Logan</strong>) reconnect after spending season 5 apart.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“The season’s been really fun, because we’ve been wanting to see Spencer and Olivia together for a really long time. It seemed that there’s always something getting in the way,” Logan, 27, told reporters during The Television Critics Association in February via <a href=# rel=noopener>Deadline</a>. “We’ll just see them this season coming together as new versions of themselves. There’s going to be some stuff in between, but I think ultimately we are going to see the relationship really transformed to something really beautiful.”</p><p>Us Weekly has reached out to The CW and Clowdus’ rep for comment.</p><p>Season 6 of All American premieres on The CW Monday, April 1, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ%2BupqSav26vy6iuna2jYrK5tdOsZJqknGKurrHRopqapl2Ws7Wx0WaapZmZoravs4yhnGaelaHBbsHNsJylm5%2BisnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emmys-2019-red-carpet-fashion-see-celeb-dresses-gowns.html><span>←</span><span>Emmys 2019 Red Carpet Fashion: See Celeb Dresses, Gowns</span></a>
